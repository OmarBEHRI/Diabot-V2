            "question": "How is my blood sugar controlled? Do I need to do anything more?",
            "reference_answer": "Blood sugar is the level of sugar in the blood. It is controlled by regular measurements with a blood glucose meter or in a laboratory. To avoid hyperglycemia, you must follow a suitable diet plan, take your medication, and do physical activity. If you have symptoms of hyperglycemia, consult a doctor without delay.",
            "model_answer": "Your blood sugar is controlled by regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels and adjusting your treatment accordingly, often with the help of your healthcare provider. This typically involves:\n\n1. **Self-monitoring of blood glucose:** Testing your blood sugar at different times of the day, including before meals (pre-meal) and after meals (post-prandial), to get a full picture of your glucose levels throughout the day. The goal is to keep pre-meal blood sugar between 4 and 7 mmol/L and post-meal levels between 4 and 10 mmol/L.\n\n2. **HbA1c testing:** This blood test reflects your average blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months. Your healthcare provider will set a target HbA1c level based on your age, type of diabetes, and other health factors.\n\n3. **Adjusting treatment:** Based on your blood glucose readings and HbA1c results, your doctor may adjust your medications, insulin doses, diet, or physical activity to help you reach your targets safely.\n\n4. **Individualized care:** Your treatment plan should be tailored to your specific needs, considering factors like your age, other health conditions, and how you respond to therapy.\n\n**Do you need to do anything more?**  \n- Continue regular blood glucose monitoring as advised.  \n- Follow your prescribed medication and insulin regimen.  \n- Maintain a healthy diet and physical activity as recommended.  \n- Keep regular appointments with your healthcare provider to review your control and adjust treatment if needed.  \n- Report any symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or high blood sugar to your doctor promptly.\n\nIf you are already doing these, you are on the right track. If youâ€™re unsure about your current monitoring routine or treatment plan, discuss this with your healthcare provider to ensure your blood sugar is well controlled and your targets are appropriate for you.",
            "evaluation": "Medical Accuracy: 10 - The AI's answer is highly accurate, providing specific details like target blood sugar ranges (4-7 mmol/L pre-meal, 4-10 mmol/L post-meal) and the role of HbA1c, which are standard in diabetes management. It correctly emphasizes individualized care and the importance of healthcare provider involvement.\nCompleteness: 10 - The AI's answer is far more comprehensive than the reference answer. It breaks down blood sugar control into distinct, actionable points (self-monitoring, HbA1c, adjusting treatment, individualized care) and thoroughly addresses the \"Do I need to do anything more?\" part with practical advice. The reference answer is very basic and misses many crucial aspects.\nClarity: 10 - The AI's answer is exceptionally clear, well-structured with bullet points, and uses language that is easy for a patient to understand without oversimplifying complex medical concepts.\nHelpfulness: 10 - This answer would be extremely helpful to a patient with diabetes. It provides actionable steps, explains the rationale behind monitoring, sets realistic targets, and clearly outlines what ongoing actions are necessary. It empowers the patient with knowledge and guidance.\nBinary Correctness: 1 - The AI's answer is not only medically correct but also exceptionally complete and helpful, far surpassing the reference answer in quality and detail.",

            "question": "My control has been good so far, but is it likely to worsen with age as my metabolism changes?",
            "reference_answer": "Diabetes control can deteriorate with age because metabolism changes and the risk of complications increases. It is therefore important to have regular follow-ups with your doctor and adjust your lifestyle and treatment if necessary. Type 1 diabetes requires specific management in children.",
            "model_answer": "Yes, it is common for insulin secretion to decline with age, which can affect metabolic control over time. In individuals with normal glucose tolerance, insulin secretion decreases by about 0.7-1% per year. This decline tends to be faster in people with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. However, good metabolic control and effective diabetes management, including lifestyle and treatment adjustments, can help maintain your health and quality of life despite these changes. It's important to regularly monitor your condition and work closely with your healthcare provider to adapt your management plan as needed.",
            "evaluation": "Medical Accuracy: 10 - The AI's answer is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the decline in insulin secretion with age as a key factor, provides specific (though approximate) percentages for the annual decline, and differentiates between normal glucose tolerance and impaired glucose tolerance/type 2 diabetes. This level of detail is medically sound.\nCompleteness: 9 - The AI's answer is very complete. It directly addresses the core question about worsening control with age due to metabolic changes, explains the underlying physiological reason (insulin secretion decline), and emphasizes the importance of ongoing management and collaboration with healthcare providers. It covers the \"why\" and the \"what to do.\" The only minor omission compared to the reference is the specific mention of Type 1 diabetes management in children, which wasn't directly asked but was included in the reference as a general point about age-related diabetes management. However, for the specific question asked, the AI's answer is very comprehensive.\nClarity: 9 - The answer is clear and easy to understand. It uses accessible language while still conveying complex medical information. The structure is logical, starting with a direct \"Yes,\" explaining the mechanism, and then offering practical advice.\nHelpfulness: 10 - This answer would be extremely helpful to a patient. It validates their concern, provides a clear explanation for why it might happen, and, most importantly, empowers them by emphasizing that good management can help maintain health and quality of life. The advice to regularly monitor and work with a healthcare provider is crucial and actionable.\nBinary Correctness: 1 - The AI's answer is essentially correct. It is medically accurate, comprehensive in addressing the specific question, and provides highly relevant and helpful information to the patient.",
