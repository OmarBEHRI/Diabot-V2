id,Question,Answer
1,"How is my blood sugar controlled? Do I need to do anything more?","Blood sugar is the level of sugar in the blood. It is controlled by regular measurements with a blood glucose meter or in a laboratory. To avoid hyperglycemia, you must follow a suitable diet plan, take your medication, and do physical activity. If you have symptoms of hyperglycemia, consult a doctor without delay."
2,"My control has been good so far, but is it likely to worsen with age as my metabolism changes?","Diabetes control can deteriorate with age because metabolism changes and the risk of complications increases. It is therefore important to have regular follow-ups with your doctor and adjust your lifestyle and treatment if necessary. Type 1 diabetes requires specific management in children."
3,"How can I better control my blood sugar?","To better control your blood sugar, you can: - Follow a balanced diet rich in fiber, prioritizing foods with a low glycemic index. - Exercise regularly, as this helps use glucose as an energy source and reduce insulin resistance. - Measure your blood sugar several times a day with a blood glucose meter or an interstitial glucose monitoring device, to adjust your treatment if necessary. - Consult your doctor for a laboratory blood sugar check every 3 months, including fasting blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin measurements."
4,"If I don't take medication, can I keep the disease under control by losing weight?","Losing weight can help you control certain conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or obesity. But you also need to adopt good eating habits and exercise regularly. If you can't lose weight despite your efforts, consult your doctor to check if there isn't a medical cause."
5,"Why do I need to take insulin?","You need to take insulin if your pancreas does not produce enough natural insulin or if your cells are resistant to insulin. Insulin helps regulate your blood sugar by facilitating the entry of glucose into cells and inhibiting glucose production by the liver. Without insulin, your blood sugar can rise dangerously and lead to diabetes complications."
7,"Would a better diet help me stop taking insulin?","No, a better diet does not allow you to stop taking insulin in the case of type 1 diabetes. Insulin is essential to regulate blood sugar and avoid complications. However, a better diet can help control blood sugar, prevent cardiovascular diseases, and achieve a healthy weight. It involves a varied, balanced diet tailored to individual needs. You should prioritize foods with a low or medium glycemic index, fiber, good quality fats, fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C, and low-fat dairy products. You should avoid added sugar, saturated and trans fatty acids, fatty meats, and processed foods."
8,"Why is my blood sugar erratic? And why can't I control it?","Blood sugar is the level of sugar in the blood. It naturally varies throughout the day depending on diet, physical activity, stress, illnesses, or medications. In people with diabetes, blood sugar can be too high or too low if treatment is not adequate or if self-monitoring is insufficient. Hyperglycemia can lead to long-term complications, such as dental infections, and hypoglycemia can cause discomfort. It is therefore important to regularly check your blood sugar and follow your doctor's recommendations. Sleep can also influence blood sugar as it regulates metabolic functions. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia or sleep apnea, can disrupt glycemic balance and increase the risk of diabetes. It is advisable to sleep approximately 8 hours per night and maintain a regular lifestyle."
9,"Can one find a definitive CURE for diabetes?","There is no definitive cure for diabetes, but a set of measures that make up the antidiabetic treatment. These measures include medications and non-medicinal treatments. Some traditional remedies can limit blood sugar levels, but they are not sufficient to resolve diabetes."
10,"HOW TO STAY MORE POSITIVE ABOUT MY CONDITION?","To stay more positive, you can: - Ask yourself questions that open up new perspectives or possibilities in your mind, such as What are the positive aspects of this situation? or What have I learned from this situation? - Create a positive environment to live in, by spending more time with people who cheer you up and make you feel positive, and by only letting in information that supports you - Be grateful for what you have and for who you are, by spending a few minutes each day feeling grateful for all the positive and exceptional things in your life - Be active and take care of your body, by exercising, eating healthy, and getting enough rest - Start your day on the right foot, by waking up with a smile and telling yourself positive affirmations."
11,"I WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ON diabetic NEUROPATHY.","Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage caused by chronic hyperglycemia. It can cause various symptoms depending on the nerves affected, such as pain, numbness, digestive or urinary problems, or heart problems. There is no specific treatment, but good blood sugar control can prevent or slow the progression of the disease."
12,"OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS, I HAVE NOTICED THAT I AM FORGETTING MORE AND MORE THINGS. CAN THIS BE ATTRIBUTED TO MY DIABETES?","Forgetfulness can have several causes, including diabetes. Diabetes can lead to memory and concentration problems, especially if blood sugar is poorly controlled. Diabetes can also promote infections or vascular complications that can affect the brain. It is therefore important to consult your doctor if you notice that you are forgetting more and more things."
13,"I AM CURRENTLY BEING EXAMINED FOR POSSIBLE SLEEP APNEA. COULD THIS BE RELATED TO DIABETES?","Sleep apnea is a disorder characterized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep. It can be linked to type 2 diabetes because a common risk factor for both conditions is overweight or obesity. Sleep apnea can also harm diabetes management by disrupting sleep, blood sugar, and appetite. It is therefore important to consult a doctor if you experience symptoms of sleep apnea, such as snoring, daytime sleepiness, or headaches."
14,"My blood sugar level has been HIGH for a long time. Can the SIDE EFFECTS be improved again?","High blood sugar for a long time can lead to diabetes complications, such as damage to the heart, kidneys, nerves, or eyes. It is possible to improve the side effects by regularly controlling your blood sugar, adjusting your diet and medication, and engaging in regular physical activity. In case of hyperglycemia symptoms, such as fatigue, thirst, dry mouth, or frequent urination, you should consult a doctor or a diabetologist."
15,"Will there be a CURE for diabetes?","Diabetes is a chronic disease that cannot be cured, but it can be treated. There are different types of diabetes, which require adapted treatments. Diabetes treatment is based on dietary balance, physical activity, and oral or injectable medications. Research for a cure and prevention efforts offer hope."
16,"CAN I GET AN IMPLANT THAT PRODUCES INSULIN FOR ME?","Yes, there are implants that can deliver insulin instead of the pancreas. These are medical devices that contain an insulin pump. These implants are capable of detecting the glucose level in the blood and releasing the necessary amount of insulin. Some implants can even generate their energy from excess sugar in the blood. These implants are still in the experimental stage and are not available to the general public."
17,"CAN THE GLAND START WORKING AGAIN?","The answer to this question depends on the type of gland and the cause of its dysfunction. There are several types of glands in the human body, such as endocrine glands, salivary glands, thyroid glands, etc. Each gland has a specific role and can be affected by infections, obstructions, tumors, or autoimmune diseases. In general, if the cause of the dysfunction is treated promptly and appropriately, the gland can start functioning normally again. For example, if a salivary gland is infected by bacteria, it can be treated with antibiotics and regain its saliva production function. If a thyroid gland is affected by an autoimmune disease causing hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, it can be regulated with medication or surgery. However, there are cases where the gland cannot fully recover and requires lifelong treatment or replacement. For example, if a kidney is damaged by a severe infection affecting kidney tissue, it can lose its ability to filter blood and eliminate waste. In this case, the person may need dialysis or a kidney transplant. So, the very short answer to your question is: yes, the gland can start working again in some cases, but not in all."
18,"WHY DOES STRESS INCREASE MY BLOOD SUGAR?","Stress increases blood sugar because it causes the release of stress hormones like adrenaline, cortisol, or glucagon, which stimulate glucose production by the liver and reduce insulin sensitivity. The body thus prepares to cope with mental and physical pressures."
19,"CAN AN INSULIN PUMP HELP CONTROL BLOOD SUGAR BETTER THAN INSULIN PENS?","An insulin pump can help control blood sugar better than insulin pens because it delivers rapid-acting insulin continuously and adapts to the person's lifestyle. It requires fewer injections and offers more discretion. However, it involves wearing a device on oneself continuously and can cause allergic reactions or accidental disconnections."
20,"WHY ARE MY HANDS AND FEET SO AFFECTED by diabetes?","Hands and feet are so affected in diabetes because too high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels that supply them. This leads to loss of sensation, poor wound healing, and a risk of infection or amputation."
21,"WILL I EVER STOP TAKING INSULIN AND PILLS AT THE SAME TIME?","If you have type 1 diabetes, you cannot stop taking insulin because your pancreas no longer produces enough. Insulin is essential to regulate your blood sugar and prevent diabetes complications. If you have type 2 diabetes, you may eventually be able to stop taking insulin if your blood sugar is well-controlled with oral medications and lifestyle changes. However, as diabetes is a progressive disease, you may eventually require insulin injections to compensate for decreased production by the pancreas. Insulin therapy becomes necessary when glycated hemoglobin remains above 8% despite other treatments or in certain specific circumstances."
22,"WHAT ABOUT AN INSULIN PUMP?","An insulin pump is a device that delivers insulin continuously or on demand to people with diabetes. It can be implanted or external and allows for better blood sugar control. It is an alternative to insulin injection treatment."
23,"What are the INJECTION SITES?","Insulin injection is done subcutaneously in 4 possible sites: the abdomen, arm, buttocks, and thigh."
24,"How can I avoid BRUISES?","To avoid bruises, you should apply ice or a cold product to the injured area as soon as possible to reduce blood flow and pain. You should also avoid heat, elevate the bruised area, and rest it. Some natural products like arnica, vitamin K, or aloe vera gel can also help resolve bruises."
25,"Are high LFT results due to diabetes?","High LFT results can be due to diabetes, but not always. Diabetes is a disease characterized by excess sugar in the blood, or hyperglycemia. It can lead to complications in various organs, including the liver. Diabetes can cause hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), hepatitis, or cirrhosis. These conditions can impair liver function and increase the levels of certain enzymes in the blood, such as transaminases or alkaline phosphatases. However, there are other possible causes of high LFT results, such as alcoholism, viral infections, medications, autoimmune diseases, or tumors. It is therefore important to consult a doctor to establish the correct diagnosis and treatment."
26,"WHAT ARE THE LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS OF HIGH GLUCOSE LEVELS?","High glucose levels can damage several organs in the body, such as the kidneys, eyes, nervous system, and heart. It can also cause symptoms such as fatigue, thirst, frequent urination, and weight loss."
27,"HOW TO PREVENT the PROGRESSION of diabetes?","To prevent the progression of diabetes, you should adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes: - A balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, low in fat, sugar, and salt - Regular physical activity, at least 30 minutes per day - Quitting smoking - Controlling weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose - Reducing stress and getting enough sleep. These measures can decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, or delay complications of type 1 or 2 diabetes."
28,"IF BLOOD SUGAR IS HIGH, WHAT SHOULD I DO?","If blood sugar is high, you must monitor your diet, limit fast sugars and saturated fats, consume fiber, engage in regular physical exercise, and regularly check your blood sugar. You must also consult a doctor to adjust treatment if necessary and avoid diabetes complications."
29,"Why is my blood sugar never CONSTANT, ALWAYS UP AND DOWN?","Blood sugar is the level of sugar in the blood. It varies depending on several factors, such as diet, physical activity, stress, medications, hormones, etc. Blood sugar is never constant, but it must remain within a normal range to avoid complications. When blood sugar is too low, it is called hypoglycemia. This can cause symptoms like fatigue, hunger, trembling, sweating, palpitations, etc. You must then quickly consume fast-acting sugar and check your blood sugar. When blood sugar is too high, it is called hyperglycemia. This can cause symptoms like thirst, dry mouth, frequent urination, fatigue, etc. You must then adjust your treatment, drink water, and check your blood sugar. Chronic hyperglycemia can lead to long-term diabetes complications. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to convulsions or loss of consciousness. To avoid excessive blood sugar variations, you must adhere to your treatment, have a balanced diet tailored to your needs, engage in regular and moderate physical activity, and avoid stress and alcohol. If you have doubts or questions about your blood sugar or your diabetes, consult your doctor or diabetologist."
30,"HOW TO BALANCE DIET, ACTIVITY, AND INSULIN, ESPECIALLY WHEN PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITY IS NOT CONSTANT?","To balance diet, activity, and insulin, you must: - Follow a varied and balanced nutrition plan, respecting portions and the distribution of carbohydrate-containing foods. - Prioritize foods with a low or medium glycemic and insulin index, which provide glucose to the blood slowly. - Engage in regular physical activity, which helps partially restore the body's sensitivity to insulin. - Adjust the insulin dose according to needs and variations in professional activity, with the help of a healthcare professional."
31,"WHAT ARE THE MAIN ADVANCES IN CARE AND WHEN WILL PATIENTS BENEFIT FROM THEM?","-The combination of a basal insulin and a GLP-1 receptor agonist (Glucagon-like peptide-1), -The combination of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i or gliptins) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors or gliflozins, not yet marketed in France)."
32,"WHAT ARE THE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS OF DIABETES MEDICATIONS?","Serious side effects of diabetes medications may include diabetic ketoacidosis and Fournier's gangrene. These effects are rare but potentially life-threatening. Other possible side effects include hypoglycemia, vomiting, muscle or joint pain, respiratory infections, diarrhea, and back pain."
33,"WHAT IS MYOPATHY AND IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT?","Myopathy is a general term for diseases that affect the muscles connected to bones. Myopathies can be inherited or develop later in life. People living with myopathy may have difficulty performing daily activities like bathing, combing their hair, or getting up from a chair. Treatment and prognosis depend on the type and severity of myopathy. Some myopathies can be treated with medication, physiotherapy, or other interventions. Others may require respiratory support or surgery. There is no definitive cure for most myopathies."
34,"IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE TO INSULIN?","Yes, there are alternatives to insulin, but they are not all effective or without risk. Possible alternatives include: - Medications that decrease sugar resistance to insulin or stimulate insulin secretion by the pancreas. - Leptin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar through pathways different from insulin and which has allowed diabetic mice to stay alive without insulin. - Insulin pumps that deliver insulin continuously and allow the dose to be adjusted according to needs. However, these alternatives are not suitable for all types of diabetes and can have side effects. It is therefore important to consult a doctor before changing treatment."
35,"CAN I TAKE MY ""BASAL"" AT A DIFFERENT TIME OF DAY TO GET BETTER CONTROL?","No, you must respect the daily administration time."
36,"ARE THERE SIMPLER WAYS TO CONTROL BLOOD SUGAR?","There are several simple ways to control blood sugar, such as: - regularly monitoring your blood sugar with a blood glucose meter or an interstitial glucose monitoring device; - choosing low glycemic index foods and consuming enough fiber; - engaging in appropriate and regular physical activity; - respecting the doses and schedules of medication or insulin treatment."
37,"HOW TO REALLY REDUCE MY BASAL INSULIN DOSE - EXERCISE, DIET, WEIGHT LOSS?","Regular physical activity (30 min per day) Adapted diet."
38,"How to manage INSULIN RESISTANCE?","Insulin resistance is a health problem that occurs when the body cannot effectively use insulin to get glucose into cells. This can lead to increased blood sugar and a risk of type 2 diabetes. To manage insulin resistance, you must adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes: - A balanced diet rich in fiber, with foods having a low or medium glycemic index, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and low-fat dairy products. - Regular physical activity, at least 30 minutes per day, which helps improve insulin sensitivity and burn excess glucose. - Sufficient sleep - The doctor may also prescribe a medication like metformin, which reduces glucose production by the liver and increases glucose uptake by muscles."
39,"What is the NEED FOR MORE FREQUENT SITE ROTATION?","Rotating insulin injection sites helps avoid bruising, infections, inflammation from injecting in the same site, fat deposits, and variations in insulin absorption."
40,"ARE THERE any INFORMATION ON PROGRESS IN TERMS OF CURE, TRANSPLANTATION, ETC.?","Human organ and tissue transplantation is a life-saving form of treatment for several serious diseases and traumas; - Pancreas transplantation is often the treatment of choice."
41,"IS THERE a POSSIBILITY THAT CHILDREN CAN HAVE hereditary DIABETES?","Yes. Type 1 diabetes is purely hereditary, but the risk of transmission is low."
42,"HOW COULD I GET DIABETES without EVER being OVERWEIGHT and with good BLOOD PRESSURE?","Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by too high sugar levels in the blood. It can be caused by several factors, some of which are not related to overweight or blood pressure. For example: - Genetic predisposition - A sedentary lifestyle - A diet too rich in refined carbohydrates - Aging."
43,"WHAT IS THE RISK of ORGAN DAMAGE in a person with diabetes?","The risk of organ damage in a person with diabetes is related to chronic hyperglycemia, which affects the walls of blood vessels and the function of several organs, mainly the kidneys, eyes, nervous system, heart, and arteries."
44,"DOES VISION DETERIORATE FASTER IN CASE OF DIABETES?","Yes, because diabetes can damage the retina, lens, iris, and internal eye pressure. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common eye complication of diabetes. It develops silently and can progressively lead to vision loss. It is therefore important to control your blood sugar and have regular eye exams (fundus examination) and consult your doctor in case of vision problems."
45,"WILL ALL TYPE 2 diabetic PATIENTS EVENTUALLY HAVE TO START INSULIN?","No, not all type 2 diabetic patients will eventually have to start insulin. Some can control their blood sugar with a healthy diet and exercise, and with oral antidiabetic medications. However, as diabetes is a progressive disease, the body may eventually require insulin injections to compensate for decreased production by the pancreas. Insulin therapy becomes necessary when glycated hemoglobin remains above 8% despite other treatments or in certain specific circumstances."
46,"What to do about skin infections in diabetics?","Skin infections in diabetics are favored by chronic hyperglycemia, which weakens the immune defenses. To prevent them, basic hygiene rules must be followed, blood sugar must be controlled, and vaccination against certain infectious diseases is important, plus injection site rotation. To treat them, a doctor should be consulted who will prescribe antibiotics appropriate for the bacterium causing the infection."
47,"CAN TYPE II DIABETES BE ""CURED"" OR ONLY MANAGED?","No, it must be managed (literally 'lived with')."
48,"WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF ANOTHER ILLNESS ON A PERSON WITH DIABETES?","The impact of another illness on a person with diabetes depends on the type and severity of the illness, as well as the level of diabetes control. Another illness, such as bacterial infections, can worsen diabetes. It is therefore important to regularly monitor your blood sugar and consult your doctor in case of a co-occurring illness with diabetes."
49,"WHY DO I KEEP GOING TO THE TOILET EVERY HOUR AND WHY AM I ALWAYS TIRED?","There are several possible causes for wanting to go to the toilet every hour and always feeling tired. Here is a list of several causes: - Urinary tract infection or cystitis; - Diabetes; - Prostate problems; - Irritable bladder syndrome, which causes chronic inflammation of the bladder and a feeling of urgent need to urinate. You may also have pain in the lower abdomen or during sexual intercourse. - You may have a neurological disease like multiple sclerosis, which affects the nervous control of the bladder and leads to urinary problems - You may have excessive fluid intake, especially in the evening or of diuretic drinks like tea, coffee, or alcohol. This can increase urine volume and frequency of urination. - You may have stress or anxiety, which can stimulate the bladder and cause frequent urges to urinate. This can also affect your sleep and energy. - You may be pregnant if you are a woman, which can increase pressure on the bladder and reduce its volume. This can also lead to increased fatigue. If you feel the need to urinate too often, it is advisable to consult your doctor to identify the cause and propose appropriate treatment."
50,"WILL DIABETES BE TRANSMITTED TO MY CHILDREN?","Genetic profile plays an important role in transmission."
51,"HOW WELL AM I MANAGING MY DIABETES?","To manage your diabetes, you must: - Take insulin or medications as prescribed by your doctor - Regularly monitor your blood sugar level - Have a healthy and balanced diet - Exercise regularly - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol - Quit smoking if you are a smoker - Check the condition of your feet."
52,"DOES DIABETES HAVE A LIFESPAN?","No, it is a chronic disease with lifelong treatment."
53,"HOW OFTEN SHOULD I MEASURE MY BLOOD SUGAR?","The frequency at which you should measure your blood sugar depends on your type of diabetes and your treatment. Here are some general recommendations: -Before and after three meals per day. Additional checks are recommended before driving, before and after intense or unexpected physical exertion, in case of unusual meals or activities, in case of suspected hypoglycemic discomfort, in case of infection... You can also consult your doctor to determine the blood sugar self-monitoring methods adapted to your situation."
54,"WHEN MY BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IS HIGH, SHOULD I TAKE INSULIN TO LOWER IT?","When your blood sugar level is high, you should take insulin to lower it if you have type 1 diabetes or if your doctor has prescribed it. Insulin allows glucose to enter the cells and reduces the sugar level in the blood. If you are not diabetic or do not need insulin, you can lower your blood sugar level by adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding stress."
55,"IS SUGAR STRICTLY FORBIDDEN OR ALLOWED IN MODERATION?","Sugar is not strictly forbidden for people with diabetes, but it should be consumed in moderation and by choosing sugars with a low glycemic index. Added sugars should be limited because they increase blood sugar levels and do not provide essential nutrients."
56,"How to understand carbohydrate intake in relation to insulin dose?","To understand carbohydrate intake in relation to insulin dose, you need to know the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, which corresponds to the amount of carbohydrates that one unit of rapid-acting insulin allows the body's cells to use. This ratio can vary depending on the person and the time of day. You also need to measure your fasting blood sugar every day and adjust your insulin dose based on your target blood sugar goal. This procedure is called dosage adjustment or titration of the insulin dose."
57,"WHY DO SOME diabetic PATIENTS HAVE TO BE AMPUTATED?","Some diabetic patients have to be amputated because they have complications that reduce blood flow or sensation in their lower limbs. This can lead to wounds or ulcers that do not heal and that can become infected or necrotic. If the infection cannot be stopped or the damage repaired, amputation may be necessary."
58,"I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE DOS AND DON'TS IN THE FIELD OF DIET for a diabetic?","The diet for diabetics must be balanced, rich in fiber, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids. You should have three regular meals a day and avoid skipping meals. Recommended foods include lentils, whole grains, leafy green vegetables, beans, nuts, flaxseeds, wild salmon, oranges, blueberries, and tomatoes. You should limit the consumption of sweet, salty, and fatty products. No foods are forbidden, but you must respect portion sizes and carbohydrate distribution."
59,"WHAT ARE THE PARTS OF MY BODY WHERE I CAN INJECT MYSELF?","The parts of the body where you can inject yourself are the arm, thigh, or abdomen. You should choose areas with subcutaneous fat."
60,"WHAT ARE THE COMPLICATIONS THAT DIABETES CAN CAUSE?","-Diabetic retinopathy;-Diabetic nephropathy;-Cardiovascular diseases;-Diabetic neuropathy;-High blood pressure;-Acute coronary syndrome;"
61,"Under what circumstances should diabetics inject insulin?","Diabetics should inject insulin when their blood sugar is too high. This is the case for people with type 1 diabetes, who are insulin-dependent. There are different types of insulin and injection regimens depending on each person's needs and lifestyle."
62,"Is diabetes a disease that can be overcome, or once a person has it, do they have it for life?","Diabetes is a chronic disease that cannot be cured, but can be treated and controlled. There are different types of diabetes, the most common of which is type 2 diabetes."
63,"What kind of special diet should a person with diabetes follow, and are there any foods they cannot eat at all?","A person with diabetes should follow a balanced, varied diet adapted to their needs. They should favor foods with a low glycemic index, rich in fiber and good fats, and limit the consumption of sweet, salty, and fatty products. No foods are forbidden, but some should be avoided or consumed in moderation, such as added sugar, sugary drinks, pastries, cold cuts, fried foods, etc. The goal is to maintain stable blood sugar levels and prevent diabetes complications."
64,"Under what circumstances is a ketogenic diet an effective treatment FOR diabetics?","Not recommended for diabetics."
65,"What are the first symptoms of diabetes?","The first symptoms of diabetes may include: fatigue, intense thirst, frequent urge to urinate, weight loss, blurred vision, slow wound healing, and recurrent infections."
66,"How can someone get diabetes so late in life? Does eating a lot of sweets cause diabetes?","You can get diabetes so late in life due to several factors, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle, certain diseases, or random events. Eating a lot of sweets does not directly cause diabetes, but it can contribute to the increase in blood glucose levels, which can lead to insulin resistance and promote the development of type 2 diabetes."
67,"Besides candy and other sugary foods, what foods should diabetics avoid?","Besides candy and other sugary foods, diabetics should avoid foods with a high glycemic index, such as white bread, white rice, white pasta, refined cereals, and canned fruits in syrup. They should also limit foods rich in saturated fats, such as cold cuts, cheese, butter, and fatty meats."
68,"On what part of the body do diabetics inject insulin?","Diabetics inject insulin under the skin using a pen, syringe, or insulin pump. They can rotate injection sites between different body regions, such as the abdomen, thighs, upper arm, or buttocks."
69,"Does cholesterol play a role in the diagnosis of diabetes?","Cholesterol plays a role in the diagnosis of diabetes because it is a cardiovascular risk factor that can worsen diabetes complications. LDL cholesterol, also known as bad cholesterol, should be below 1.3 g/l in people with diabetes. HDL cholesterol, also known as good cholesterol, should be above 0.35 g/l because it protects against cardiovascular diseases. Blood cholesterol levels are measured by a fasting blood test."
70,"What is it about obesity that makes someone more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes?","Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes because it leads to insulin resistance, meaning a decrease in the effectiveness of the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels."
71,"How much will you have to change your lifestyle to cope with diabetes?","To cope with diabetes, you must change your lifestyle by adopting a healthy and balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, quitting smoking and alcohol if you are a smoker, and adhering to your medication treatment. These changes can help normalize blood sugar levels and prevent diabetes complications."
72,"Can a change in diet prevent the onset of diabetes in someone genetically predisposed to getting it?","A change in diet can reduce the risk of diabetes in a person genetically predisposed to getting it, but not necessarily prevent it. There is no anti-diabetes diet, but certain dietary practices are beneficial for health and diabetes control. It is also important to engage in appropriate and regular physical activity."
73,"What role does increased fat mass play in increasing the risk of diabetes?","Increased fat mass, especially in the abdominal region, leads to insulin resistance, meaning a decrease in the effect of insulin on cells. Insulin is the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. When insulin no longer acts properly, glucose accumulates in the blood, causing hyperglycemia, which is a sign of diabetes. Fat mass also releases hormones and inflammatory molecules that disrupt the functioning of the pancreas, the organ that produces insulin."
74,"What is the average weight of a person diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes?","The average weight of a person diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is not easy to determine as it depends on many factors such as age, sex, height, physical activity, etc. However, we know that abdominal obesity is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. It is therefore recommended for people with type 2 diabetes to lose weight if their body mass index is above 25. A weight loss of 5 to 10% of initial weight can have a positive impact on blood sugar. To do this, you should adopt a balanced diet, low in added sugars and saturated fats, and rich in fiber, vegetables, fruits, and low glycemic index foods. You should also engage in regular physical activity."
75,"What types of food should people with Type 2 diabetes avoid?","People with type 2 diabetes should avoid foods rich in added sugars, saturated fatty acids, and white flour. These foods increase blood sugar and the risk of cardiovascular diseases."
76,"What are the preventive measures to take if your family is known to have diabetes?","The preventive measures to take if your family is known to have diabetes are: - Have a healthy and balanced diet, rich in fiber and low in saturated fats. - Engage in regular physical activity, at least 30 minutes per day. - Maintain a normal weight and avoid overweight and obesity. - Regularly check your blood sugar and consult a doctor in case of diabetes symptoms."
77,"If I get diabetes, is it true that I can fight it with an excellent diet instead of taking medication?","Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by excess sugar in the blood. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1, which requires insulin injections to regulate blood sugar, and type 2, which can be treated with oral medications and/or lifestyle modifications. A balanced diet adapted to diabetes is essential to prevent or delay diabetes complications, such as cardiovascular diseases, nerve or kidney damage, or blindness. It is not a restrictive diet, but a varied diet, rich in fiber, fruits and vegetables, fish, dairy products, and low glycemic index starchy foods, and low in saturated fats, salt, and added sugar. Diet alone is not enough to fight type 2 diabetes. It must be combined with regular physical activity, blood sugar control, and medical follow-up. Antidiabetic medications are often necessary to help maintain blood sugar within the normal range and avoid hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Diabetes treatment must be personalized according to the needs and goals of each patient."
78,"Can surgery be performed to ""fix"" the cause of diabetes?","Surgery can be performed to ""fix"" the cause of diabetes in some cases, but not all. Diabetes is a disease characterized by a sugar level that is too high in the blood. A possible surgical procedure to ""fix"" the cause of diabetes is the transplantation of pancreatic cells or Langerhans islets, which are the structures containing the insulin-producing cells. This transplant can be performed from a deceased donor or a living donor. However, this procedure is still experimental and carries risks of rejection and side effects related to immunosuppressant medications."
79,"Is there a symptom or group of symptoms a person can feel very early on that signals the onset of diabetes?","There are several symptoms that can indicate diabetes, such as fatigue, intense thirst, increased need to urinate, unexplained weight loss, blurred vision, or frequent infections. These symptoms can appear suddenly or gradually depending on the type of diabetes. Diabetes is diagnosed by a blood test that measures blood sugar levels."
80,"How has the daily maintenance, blood checks, and medication administration changed over the last ten years for diabetics?","Daily maintenance, blood checks, and medication administration have changed over the last ten years for diabetics thanks to technological advances and new recommendations. For example: - Diabetics can use wearable devices such as insulin pumps, glucose sensors, or injector pens to facilitate insulin administration and blood sugar control. - Diabetics can benefit from labile blood products like fresh frozen plasma in case of diabetes-related complications, such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar syndrome. - Diabetics must follow exercise standards for safe medication administration, which include clinical assessment, clinical intervention, and continuity of care."
81,"What is the life expectancy for someone with Type 2 diabetes?","The life expectancy for a person with type 2 diabetes can be reduced by about 10 years on average, according to several reports. However, life expectancy can vary depending on the person's health and treatment and if the patient follows a healthy lifestyle with regular monitoring, avoiding anything that can damage their body."
82,"My mother has Type 2 diabetes. Does that increase my risk?","Yes, type 2 diabetes has a significant family factor. If one of your parents has this disease, you have about a 40% risk of developing it as well. If both parents have type 2 diabetes, the risk rises to 70%. However, the genetic factor alone is not sufficient. Other risk factors such as age, overweight, lack of physical activity, or belonging to certain populations must also be taken into account."
83,"Can diabetes affect a person's mood? What are the first symptoms of diabetes?","Diabetes can affect a person's mood in several ways. According to sources, diabetes can cause mood swings if blood sugar is low or high, which can make the person irritable, confused, and not themselves. Diabetes can also lead to dysphoria, anxiety, and irritability due to the stress related to managing the disease and the risk of complications. These emotional problems can sometimes develop into major depressive disorders or anxiety disorders. The first symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on the type of diabetes, but they generally include: - Excessive thirst and dry mouth - Increased urination - Unusual fatigue - Unexplained weight loss - Blurred vision - Frequent or hard-to-heal infections - Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet If you think you have these symptoms, it is important to consult a doctor to be screened for diabetes and receive appropriate treatment."
84,"Can Type II diabetes be reversed or cured, such as by changing your diet and becoming healthier?","Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that affects glucose metabolism. It cannot be definitively reversed or put into remission or cured, but it must be controlled through lifestyle and dietary measures and medications. You generally need to lose weight, eat healthily, and exercise. A very low-calorie or low-carbohydrate diet may help. You must also maintain a healthy lifestyle after remission to avoid relapse."
85,"Have any new medications to treat diabetes been approved in recent years?","Yes, new medications to treat diabetes have been approved in recent years. Among them are: - Tirzepatide, a medication that mimics two natural hormones that release insulin and suppress appetite. - PATAS, a peptide that restores the ability of fatty tissues to capture glucose from the blood and convert it into beneficial lipids. - Linagliptin, a medication that is not metabolized by the kidneys and stimulates insulin secretion. These medications represent new treatment avenues for people with type 2 diabetes."
86,"I know that physical exercise can be beneficial for diabetes, but are there specific exercises that yield better results?","Physical exercise is beneficial for diabetes because it lowers blood sugar and reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications. It is recommended to engage in 30 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity each day, such as brisk walking, swimming, dancing, or strength training. You must adapt the activity to your level and your treatment, and take some precautions to avoid hypoglycemia."
87,"Can a low-carb diet reverse Type 2 diabetes?","According to some studies, a low-carb diet can help reduce blood sugar and improve kidney function in people with diabetes. However, this diet is not effective for all diabetics and can be difficult to follow in the long term. It is therefore advisable to consult a doctor before adopting it."
88,"Does prediabetes always turn into diabetes?","No, prediabetes does not always turn into diabetes. Prediabetes is a situation where blood sugar is higher than normal with early insulin resistance but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but it is possible to prevent or delay it by adopting a healthy lifestyle. It is important to get screened and follow your doctor's recommendations."
89,"Is Type 2 diabetes hereditary or related to diet?","Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by persistently high glucose levels in the blood. It is mainly linked to lifestyle, particularly an unbalanced diet, lack of physical activity, and overweight. There is also a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes, but it is not sufficient to trigger the disease. Type 1 diabetes, on the other hand, is strongly hereditary and caused by an autoimmune destruction of the pancreas cells."
90,"Is diabetes a genetic disease that makes some people more likely to get it?","Diabetes is not a genetic disease in most cases, but there can be a genetic predisposition to developing it. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that may be linked to genetics or triggered by a viral infection. Type 2 diabetes is mainly related to lifestyle and obesity. Gestational diabetes is favored by the physiological disruptions of pregnancy."
91,"What can be done to prevent diabetes, and are preventive measures effective?","To prevent type 2 diabetes, it is recommended to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which includes a balanced diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal weight, and quitting smoking and alcohol. These preventive measures are effective in reducing the risk of developing diabetes or limiting its complications. Gestational diabetes can be prevented by screening and medical monitoring during pregnancy. Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented."
92,"How has diabetes treatment progressed in recent years?","Diabetes treatment has progressed in recent years thanks to the discovery of insulin in 1921, the improvement of blood sugar control methods, the development of new antihyperglycemic medications, and technological innovation. However, diabetes remains a disease that affects more and more people worldwide and requires appropriate prevention, education, and monitoring."
93,"What are the causes of diabetes?","Diabetes is a disease characterized by an excess of sugar in the blood. There are several types of diabetes, which have different causes: - Type 1 diabetes is due to the destruction of the pancreas cells that produce insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar. It is an autoimmune disease, linked to genetic predisposition and environmental factors. - Type 2 diabetes is due to the resistance of cells to the action of insulin, which leads to chronic hyperglycemia. It is a metabolic disease, favored by overweight, sedentary lifestyle, unbalanced diet, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and intestinal dysbiosis. - Gestational diabetes is a disorder of blood sugar regulation that appears in some pregnant women. It is due to hormonal disturbances during pregnancy and a genetic predisposition."
94,"What should be done to cure diabetes?","There is no definitive treatment to cure type 2 diabetes, but it is possible to achieve control of the disease by improving one's lifestyle. To do this, you must lose weight, engage in regular physical activity, adopt a varied and balanced diet, avoid stress, and quit smoking and alcohol. Some medical or surgical treatments can also help control blood sugar and stimulate insulin production."
95,"How does it manifest? (Regarding gangrene)","For example, if you want to know how gangrene manifests, I can tell you that the symptoms most often associated with gangrene are: stiffness and visible swelling in the affected part, loss of sensation and significant pain in the gangrenous area, the appearance of blisters or even ulcers, cold and pale skin on the affected area."
96,"Can a pancreas transplant cure diabetes?","According to research results, a pancreas transplant can cure type 1 diabetes; it is the only treatment capable of doing so. However, this transplant is reserved for cases of unstable diabetes and/or complicated by end-stage renal failure."
97,"What will your diet be like if you have diabetes?","- You should have three balanced meals per day and, if needed, snacks. - You should vary foods from different food groups: vegetables and fruits, starches, milk and substitutes, meats and substitutes. - You should limit foods rich in high glycemic index carbohydrates, saturated and trans fats, salt, and sugar. - You should prioritize foods rich in dietary fiber, fatty fish, turmeric, and extra virgin olive oil. - You should drink water rather than fruit juices or sugary drinks."
98,"Will you ever no longer have to prick your finger to measure your blood sugar?","Some people with diabetes no longer need to prick their finger to measure their blood sugar, as they use innovative devices that measure blood sugar levels continuously and painlessly."
99,"What is the most difficult aspect of diabetes?","Diabetes requires lifelong treatment, based on a healthy diet, regular physical activity, medications, and medical follow-up. Diabetes symptoms can be varied and sometimes subtle, such as thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, or weight loss. The most difficult aspect of diabetes can depend on each person and their experience with the disease. Some may find it hard to follow dietary recommendations or inject insulin. Others may suffer from the consequences of diabetes on their quality of life or morale. Still others may fear the complications or risks associated with diabetes. There is no universal answer to this question, but there are ways to live better with diabetes, such as getting support from healthcare professionals, participating in therapeutic education programs, or joining patient associations."
100,"How does diabetes affect a person's daily life and activities?","Diabetes affects a person's daily life and activities by requiring them to monitor their blood sugar, follow an adapted diet, exercise regularly, and take medication if necessary. Diabetes can also lead to complications affecting the heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels, which can reduce the diabetic person's quality of life and independence. Diabetes can also impact the diabetic person's professional and social life, as they must adapt their work, hobbies, and relationships to the constraints of their condition."
101,"With age, does diabetes become more troublesome and harder to treat?","Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects vital organs. With age, diabetes can become more troublesome and harder to treat because it increases the risk of cardiovascular, kidney, nerve, and vision complications. Type 2 diabetes, which is the most common, is also more dangerous when it appears at a young age. It is therefore important to prevent and control diabetes through a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and appropriate medications."
102,"I understand that two fasting values above 1.26g/dL trigger a diagnosis of Type II diabetes, but will a doctor automatically start a patient on medication at that stage, or will they still allow a chance to lower these levels through diet and/or exercise?","The doctor can decide to prescribe medication right after diagnosis or after a trial period of lifestyle and dietary measures. The goal is to prevent diabetes complications by keeping blood sugar levels within normal values."
103,"I have read that Type II diabetes can sometimes be reversed through substantial changes in diet and exercise habits. Is this true?","Yes, it is possible to reduce or even reverse Type II diabetes through substantial changes in diet and exercise habits. These measures can improve insulin sensitivity, lower blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin levels, and prevent or delay diabetes complications. It is recommended to consume a balanced and varied diet, rich in dietary fiber and low in saturated, trans fats, and salt, and to engage in regular physical activity adapted to one's abilities."
104,"If I've been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, can I avoid full-blown diabetes by adopting good eating and exercise habits?","Yes, you can avoid full-blown diabetes by adopting good eating and exercise habits if you have pre-diabetes. Prediabetes is a blood sugar disorder that can be reversible with lifestyle changes. It is important to lose weight, eat healthily, reduce fats and sugars, and increase physical activity to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes."
105,"What can we do as a community to fight diabetes and curb its spread?","To fight diabetes and curb its spread, we can, as a community: - Raise awareness about diabetes risk factors and prevention methods - Encourage regular physical activity and a balanced diet - Screen for diabetes as early as possible and follow appropriate treatment - Support people with diabetes and help them manage their condition. These measures can contribute to reducing the incidence and complications of diabetes."
106,"What changes need to be made to the lifestyle of a person recently diagnosed with diabetes?","The changes to be made to the lifestyle of a person recently diagnosed with diabetes are: - Adopt a healthy and balanced diet, limiting sugars and fats. - Engage in regular physical activity, adapted to one's abilities. - Lose weight if necessary, to reduce insulin resistance. - Monitor blood sugar and take medications or insulin as prescribed. - Set realistic and progressive goals, and get support from healthcare professionals."
107,"Can diabetes be prevented from a young age?","Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that can be prevented or delayed by healthy lifestyle choices, such as: - having a healthy weight - staying physically active - eating healthily - avoiding sugar and saturated fats - not smoking tobacco. Type 2 diabetes can also be influenced by genetic or environmental factors. It is therefore important to get regular screening and treat any potential complications."
108,"What are the ways to know if one has diabetes?","To know if you have diabetes, you should consult a doctor who will prescribe blood tests to measure the sugar level in your blood. The diagnosis of diabetes is established when fasting blood sugar is equal to or greater than 1.26 g/l or 7 mmol/l of blood on two successive measurements. There are also other signs and symptoms of diabetes, such as excessive thirst, excessive hunger, blurred vision, frequent urination, fatigue, or wounds that do not heal."
109,"Does ""adult onset diabetes"" really exist? Can one become diabetic simply by gaining too much weight?","Adult-onset diabetes is another name for type 2 diabetes, which is the most common and rapidly increasing worldwide. It is characterized by a decrease in cell sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar concentration. It generally appears after age 40 and is linked to changes in lifestyles, especially diets that are too rich or unbalanced and lack of physical activity. It is associated with overweight and obesity. A genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes sensitivity may exist. Therefore, one can become diabetic simply by gaining too much weight, but this is not the only risk factor. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by a balanced diet and regular physical activity."
110,"If adult onset diabetes is real, can one get rid of diabetes by losing weight, for example?","Adult-onset diabetes, or type 2 diabetes, is a chronic disease characterized by insulin resistance, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Abdominal obesity, meaning fat located in the belly area, is one of the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Losing weight can help improve blood sugar control and reduce the need for medications in people with type 2 diabetes. However, losing weight does not cure diabetes, and one must continue to follow a balanced diet and exercise regularly. Medical follow-up must also continue to adjust treatment if needed and prevent diabetes complications. In summary, losing weight can be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes, but it is not a miracle solution and one must remain vigilant."
111,"What are the early symptoms of diabetes?","- For type 1 diabetes, symptoms are often sudden and include: intense thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision. - For type 2 diabetes, symptoms are often subtle or absent and include: fatigue, moderate thirst, more abundant urine, slow wound healing, frequent infections. Diabetes is diagnosed by a blood test that measures blood sugar levels."
112,"What is the most important step one can take to avoid becoming diabetic?","The most important step one can take to avoid becoming diabetic is to have a healthy diet and regular physical activity. You must also monitor your weight. These measures help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes, which is the most common and most preventable."
113,"Does a person with diabetes live a shorter life than a non-diabetic person?","On average, a person with diabetes lives 10 years less than a non-diabetic person. However, if diabetes is well treated and controlled, it is possible to live as long as a non-diabetic."
114,"Can the symptoms of Type 2 diabetes be minimized, or completely cured, by lifestyle changes alone?","The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be minimized, but not completely cured, by lifestyle changes alone. A healthy diet, regular physical activity, and a normal weight are all ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. However, over time, these measures may not be sufficient to control blood sugar, and people with type 2 diabetes may need oral medications or insulin."
115,"How does one manage the genetic risk factors for Type 2 diabetes?","Genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes are linked to the presence of certain genes that affect the production or action of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. These genes are inherited from parents and can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, especially if other environmental factors are present, such as overweight, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, or an unbalanced diet. To manage genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes, it is recommended to undergo regular diabetes screening for individuals with a family history of the disease, and to adopt a healthy lifestyle that limits other risk factors. This involves maintaining a normal weight, engaging in regular physical activity, eating a balanced and varied diet, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol."
116,"What are the most important changes to make to the lifestyle of someone with Type 2 diabetes?","The most important changes to make to the lifestyle of someone with Type 2 diabetes are weight loss if necessary, regular physical activity, and a balanced diet. These measures can help control blood sugar and prevent diabetes complications."
117,"My mother suffered from full liver failure not too long ago, and she was diagnosed with Type II diabetes about 10 years ago. Could the liver failure have been caused by the diabetes?","Liver failure can be caused by type 2 diabetes in some cases. Type 2 diabetes causes insulin resistance which affects liver function and can lead to hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) or cirrhosis."
118,"Is it possible that Type II diabetes is actually Type I diabetes that went undiagnosed for decades?","No, it is not possible that type II diabetes is actually type I diabetes that went undiagnosed for decades. Type I diabetes and type II diabetes are two different diseases with distinct causes and mechanisms. Type I diabetes is due to a lack of insulin secretion by the pancreas, caused by an autoimmune destruction of the beta cells that produce this hormone. Type I diabetes generally manifests in young people and requires lifelong treatment with insulin injections. Type II diabetes is due to poor utilization of insulin by the body's cells, which become resistant to its action. Type II diabetes develops very gradually, insidiously over many years, and is often associated with obesity, lack of physical activity, and genetic factors."
119,"Can Type II diabetes be completely cured?","There is no definitive treatment to cure type 2 diabetes, but it is possible to achieve complete and lasting remission by changing one's lifestyle habits. However, it is important to act quickly, before the pancreas is too damaged by hyperglycemia."
120,"Does being diabetic mean I'm more prone to other medical problems?","Yes, diabetes can lead to medical complications if it is not well controlled. These complications can be acute, such as hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, or chronic, such as cardiovascular diseases, strokes, kidney diseases, nerve damage, eye damage, skin problems, or cognitive disorders. Diabetes is also a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, myocardial infarction, strokes, and lower limb amputation."
121,"How often should I test my blood sugar, and what should I do if it is too high or too low?","Blood sugar testing frequency depends on the type of diabetes and treatment. It is recommended at least four times a day for people with type 1 diabetes and varies for people with type 2 diabetes. Blood sugar targets are set between 70 and 120 mg/dl before meals and < 180 mg/dl after meals. If blood sugar is too low, you should eat or drink fast-acting carbohydrates, wait 10 to 15 minutes, recheck blood sugar, and repeat treatment if necessary. If blood sugar is too high, you should try to find the causes and discuss with the healthcare team the need to adjust treatment."
122,"Are there any new medications I could be using to manage my diabetes?","There are new medications for type 2 diabetes that can stimulate insulin secretion, reduce weight, and improve blood sugar control. For example, tirzepatide, Lyxumia, or PATAS. These medications are injected subcutaneously and can be combined with other treatments. They are not yet available on the market or are being evaluated by health authorities."
123,"Does diabetes always cause complications in the limbs with age?","It increases the risk of lower limb arteriopathy. This is damage to the large blood vessels that can cause poor blood supply to the legs and feet. Diabetes complications in the lower limbs can be prevented by good blood sugar control and management of cardiovascular risk factors."
124,"Does diabetes directly cause or increase the risk of other serious diseases?","Diabetes can directly cause or increase the risk of other serious diseases, particularly cardiovascular, kidney, nerve, and eye diseases. Diabetes damages blood vessels and promotes the deposit of fats on artery walls, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes, chronic kidney failure, and vision loss. Diabetes also affects the small arteries that supply the kidneys, the nerves in the lower limbs, and the retina, which are called microvascular complications."
125,"Is there a genetic predisposition to diabetes? Or is it purely a matter of diet?","There is a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes, especially if a close relative has or has had this disease. But the genetic factor is not enough. Type 2 diabetes is also linked to lifestyle changes, particularly diets that are too rich or unbalanced and lack of physical activity. These factors promote overweight and obesity, which are significant risks for type 2 diabetes. Having a healthy diet and regular physical activity are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes."
126,"Will diabetes ever be ""cured""?","Diabetes is a chronic disease that cannot be completely cured, but can be controlled with medication, diets, or surgeries. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can be reversed with significant weight loss, but this does not mean the disease has disappeared. There is also a risk that COVID-19 may cause diabetes in some infected patients."
127,"Are there any natural remedies for diabetes that have shown promise?","There are natural remedies for diabetes that have shown promise, such as berberine, bitter melon, Ceylon cinnamon, turmeric, black pepper, ginger, American ginseng, aloe vera, and blueberry leaves. These plants have properties that help regulate blood sugar, stimulate insulin, or protect the kidneys. It is recommended to follow an adapted diet and medical follow-up in case of diabetes."
128,"Is diabetes curable? In other words, can one get completely rid of diabetes with no lingering effects? Or is it a disease one has to live with?","Type 1 diabetes is not curable, but it can be treated with insulin injections and regular blood sugar monitoring. Type 2 diabetes is also not curable, but it can be alleviated with good lifestyle habits and medications that help reduce blood sugar levels. However, there are rare cases where type 2 diabetes can disappear completely, particularly in people who lose a lot of weight or undergo bariatric surgery. These cases are called diabetes remissions and are often temporary. In summary, diabetes is not curable in most cases, but it can be controlled or alleviated with appropriate treatments. Therefore, it is a disease one must live with, but which does not prevent having a good quality of life if medical recommendations are followed."
129,"Are there any ways to tell if one is predisposed to diabetes even if they are unaware of their family having a history of diabetes?","The only way to confirm if you have diabetes is to consult your doctor for blood tests. Your doctor can order two types of tests for diabetes: fasting blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin. These tests measure your blood sugar level and can detect potential prediabetes or diabetes. There are also symptoms that can alert you to a risk of diabetes, such as excessive thirst, excessive hunger, blurred vision, frequent urination, fatigue, or wounds that do not heal. If you have one or more of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult your doctor. Finally, there are risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing diabetes, such as age, overweight, lack of physical activity, smoking, or high blood pressure. You can reduce your risk by adopting a healthy lifestyle, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly."
130,"What are the best ways to prevent diabetes?","The best ways to prevent diabetes are: - Engage in regular physical activity to lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin action. - Lose weight if overweight or obese, as excess fat can harm insulin production or utilization. - Reduce the glycemic index and load of your diet by avoiding foods rich in fast sugars like sweets, fruit juices, or refined products. - Vary fruits and vegetables, especially those with a low glycemic index like apples, berries, or eggplants. - Eat fish, which contains omega-3 fatty acids beneficial for cardiovascular health and blood sugar control. - Eat slowly and at regular times to avoid blood sugar spikes and promote satiety. - Have your blood sugar checked regularly, especially if you have risk factors like age, family history, or certain conditions. - Quit smoking, which increases the risk of diabetes complications like cardiovascular or kidney diseases."
131,"Are there variations in the severity of diabetes and what determines the severity?","Yes, there are variations in the severity of diabetes depending on the blood sugar level, the type of diabetes, associated complications, and cardiovascular risk. The severity of diabetes depends on several factors, such as age, duration, lifestyle, family history, available treatments, and medical follow-up."
132,"Is diabetes genetic and what is the probability of a child getting it if one parent has it?","The probability of a child developing diabetes if one parent has it depends on the type of diabetes: it is 5% for type 1 diabetes and 40% for type 2 diabetes. If both parents have diabetes, the risk increases to 70% for type 2 diabetes."
133,"What are the main differences in severity and symptoms between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes?","They have different causes, symptoms, and treatments. Type 1 diabetes is due to a lack of insulin secretion by the pancreas, caused by the destruction of the cells that produce it by the immune system. It appears most often in children or young adults and manifests with sudden symptoms such as intense thirst, increased need to urinate, weight loss, fatigue, or blurred vision. Treatment is based on daily insulin injections to regulate blood sugar. Type 2 diabetes is due to insulin resistance, meaning that the insulin secreted by the pancreas is not effective enough to allow sugar to enter the cells. It appears most often in older adults, overweight people, or those with a family history of diabetes. It can remain symptom-free for a long time or manifest through complications such as infections, vision problems, or cardiovascular issues. Treatment is based on lifestyle and dietary measures and oral or injectable antidiabetic medications. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are long-term conditions that require regular medical follow-up and are covered 100% by health insurance."
134,"What can I do to avoid getting either type of diabetes and what symptoms should I watch out for?","To avoid getting type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you should adopt a healthy lifestyle, which includes a balanced diet, regular physical activity, stress management, and quitting smoking. You should also monitor your weight and have your blood sugar checked regularly. The symptoms to watch out for are: intense thirst, frequent urination, unusual fatigue, unexplained weight loss, recurrent infections, blurred vision, and poorly healing wounds."
135,"COULD INSULIN AFFECT MY SKIN?","Yes, insulin injections can cause skin problems such as dents or lumps. Hence the importance of changing the needle with each injection and regularly examining the skin."
136,"Can insulin injections CAUSE RASHES?","Yes, insulin injections can cause rashes in some cases. These can be allergic reactions to the medication or needle, injection site infections, lipodystrophies, acne, hematomas, or bleeding. These complications are rarer with newer generations of insulin and shorter needles. It is important to regularly change the injection site and consult a doctor in case of a persistent or severe skin reaction."
137,"Can insulin injections CAUSE ALLERGIES TO VARIOUS PRODUCTS?","Insulin injections can cause local or generalized allergic reactions in some people. These reactions have become rare since the introduction of recombinant human insulin. Symptoms can include redness, itching, swelling, or nodules at the injection site, or more severe manifestations such as hives, asthma, or anaphylactic shock. Possible causes of an insulin allergy are sensitization to insulin proteins, additives, or impurities present in insulin preparations. Insulin injections do not directly cause allergies to other products, but they can be associated with other types of allergies in people with diabetes. For example, some people may be allergic to the adhesives used to secure catheters or insulin pumps. Others may develop food allergies, particularly to gluten, milk, or eggs, which can affect blood sugar control and require treatment adjustment."
138,"WHAT CAN HELP MY DIABETES?","-Follow your doctor's recommendations.-Take the medications prescribed by your doctor, whether insulin or oral antidiabetics. -Regularly monitor your blood sugar.-Have a healthy and balanced diet, prioritizing foods with a low glycemic index.-Engage in regular physical activity adapted to your health condition.- Consult a nutritionist or dietitian to help you develop a personalized meal plan."
139,"HOW TO EASILY MANAGE BLOOD SUGAR?","- Regularly measure your blood sugar.- Monitor your diet by reducing fast sugars and saturated fats. - Consume complex carbohydrates and fiber with each meal to stabilize blood sugar. - Prioritize foods with a low glycemic index, such as traditional bread or legumes. - Drink plenty of water and exercise regularly to increase insulin sensitivity."
140,"Why is my blood sugar increasing DESPITE adequate INSULIN intake?","Your blood sugar may increase despite adequate insulin intake for several reasons, such as: dietary deviations, stress, infection, taking medication (e.g., corticosteroids). In case of severe or persistent hyperglycemia, you should consult a doctor without delay."
141,"Why does my blood sugar increase DESPITE a balanced DIET?","Your blood sugar may increase despite a balanced diet for several reasons, such as: lack of insulin, stress, infection, certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids). If in doubt, consult your doctor."
142,"In the future, is it possible to consider treatment other than injection, such as insulin patches?","Insulin patches are devices that deliver insulin through the skin, like an injection. There are two types of insulin patches: patch pumps and experimental patches. Patch pumps are FDA-approved systems that require a medical prescription. They are programmable and can deliver basal and bolus doses of rapid-acting insulin. Experimental patches are research projects aimed at delivering insulin without a needle. They are not yet available for humans. Results of clinical trials and approval by health authorities will be needed for experimental patches."
143,"WHY IS IT GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO CONTROL MY BLOOD SUGAR WITH AGE?","Blood sugar increases with age due to several factors, including family history, stress and depression, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. These factors favor the development of type 2 diabetes, which is most common in older adults."
144,"Does taking other MEDICATIONS impact MY DIABETES CONTROL?","Taking other medications can impact your diabetes control. Some medications can increase or decrease the effect of insulin or oral antidiabetics. Other medications can affect liver function and/or damage it, which can disrupt glucose metabolism. It is therefore important to consult your doctor before taking any other medication, including herbal remedies, drugs, or dietary supplements."
145,"MORE INFORMATION ON DIET for people with diabetes?","The diet for people with diabetes should be balanced, rich in fiber, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids. You should have three regular meals per day and avoid skipping meals. Recommended foods include lentils, whole grains, leafy green vegetables, beans, nuts, flaxseeds, wild salmon, oranges, blueberries, and tomatoes. Eggs are also beneficial for diabetics. You should limit the consumption of sweet, salty, and fatty foods."
146,"What is the effect of diabetes on the EYES?","Diabetes can affect the eyes by causing complications in the retina, vitreous humor, or optic nerve."
147,"ARE THERE NEW TREATMENTS AVAILABLE for diabetes?","There are several new treatments for diabetes, including: - Tirzepatide, an injectable medication that activates two hormonal receptors to stimulate insulin secretion and reduce weight. - Bariatric surgery, a procedure that reduces the size of the stomach and can improve blood sugar control and make diabetes disappear in some overweight individuals. - The artificial pancreas, a device that combines a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump that automatically injects adequate insulin doses using artificial intelligence. - The Eversense sensor, a continuous glucose sensor implanted under the skin that sends data to an app and alerts in case of hypo or hyperglycemia. - SGLT2 inhibitors, oral medications that lower blood sugar by facilitating glucose elimination in the urine."
148,"IS LIFESTYLE OR DIET THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO TREATMENT?","Yes, lifestyle or diet is a main and essential contributing factor to diabetes treatment. A healthy and balanced diet,"
149,"How to manage WEIGHT PROBLEMS in people with diabetes?","To manage weight problems in people with diabetes, you need to: -consult your doctor and follow your treatment.-adopt a balanced, varied diet low in sugars and fats. -engage in regular physical activity."
150,"INSULIN PUMPS what's the benefit?","An insulin pump is a device that allows people with diabetes to receive insulin continuously and more accurately than with multiple injections. The benefit of the insulin pump is that it offers better blood sugar control, greater freedom, and improved quality of life by avoiding multiple insulin injections. The insulin pump is recommended when diabetes is poorly controlled despite treatment with multiple injections."
151,"Will the situation worsen over time for a person with diabetes?","The situation can worsen over time for a person with diabetes if their blood sugar is not controlled. Diabetes can lead to complications that affect almost every organ in the body, such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels."
152,"WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE HBA1C AND DOES IT VARY FROM PATIENT TO PATIENT?","HbA1c is a blood test that measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2 or 3 months. It is used to diagnose and monitor diabetes. An acceptable HbA1c varies depending on the person and situation, but in general, it is recommended to have an HbA1c below 7% or 53 mmol/mol if you have diabetes, and below 6% or 42 mmol/mol if you are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can help you determine your personal HbA1c target based on your age, health status, and treatments."
153,"Can MEDICATIONS REPLACE insulin INJECTIONS?","Medications cannot replace insulin injections for people with type 1 diabetes, as their pancreas does not produce enough insulin. Therefore, they must inject insulin daily to control their blood sugar. For people with type 2 diabetes, there are medications called oral antidiabetics."
154,"Should MY EXTENDED FAMILY BE TESTED REGULARLY for diabetes?","No, unless a family member shows signs suggestive of diabetes."
155,"What can a person with diabetes eat?","A person with diabetes can eat a variety of foods from different food groups, while limiting the consumption of sugary and low-nutrient foods, and paying particular attention to portion sizes and the distribution of carbohydrate-containing foods. No foods are strictly forbidden, but a balanced diet and regular meal times must be observed."
156,"Is it possible to RECEIVE INSULIN BY PUMP AS NEEDED, RATHER THAN HAVING TO INJECT CONSTANTLY?","Yes, it is possible to receive insulin by pump as needed, rather than having to inject constantly. There are different types of insulin pumps that allow for continuous infusion of rapid-acting insulin and delivery of extra doses at mealtimes or in case of hyperglycemia. The insulin pump can offer better blood sugar control, greater freedom, and improved quality of life for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, an insulin pump requires a medical prescription, training, as well as regular monitoring and adjustment."
157,"HOW DO OTHER MEDICATIONS INTERACT WITH DIABETES?","Certain medications can alter the action of antidiabetic medications by increasing or decreasing their effect on blood sugar. This can lead to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. It is therefore important to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter ones."
158,"How do OTHER MEDICATIONS INTERACT With anti-DIABETIC MEDICATIONS?","Antidiabetic medications can interact with other medications and modify their effect on the body. For example, certain medications can increase or decrease blood sugar levels, which can lead to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. It is therefore important to consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking other medications with your antidiabetics."
