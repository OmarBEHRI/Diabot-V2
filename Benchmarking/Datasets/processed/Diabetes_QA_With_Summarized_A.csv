88,"Does prediabetes always turn into diabetes?","No, prediabetes does not always progress to diabetes. A healthy lifestyle can prevent or delay its onset.","Yes, prediabetes is just another name for early-stage diabetes.","Yes, once you have prediabetes, there is nothing you can do to stop it.","No, prediabetes is just a temporary problem that goes away on its own."
89,"Is type 2 diabetes hereditary or related to diet?","Type 2 diabetes is primarily linked to lifestyle (diet, physical activity), with a genetic predisposition.","Type 2 diabetes is solely linked to a lack of insulin and has nothing to do with weight.","Type 2 diabetes is a disease that you only catch by eating too much sugar, like a virus.","Type 2 diabetes is a disease that affects only older people and is unavoidable."
90,"Is diabetes a genetic disease that makes some people more likely to contract it?","Diabetes is not always genetic, but a predisposition exists, especially for type 1. Type 2 is linked to lifestyle.","Yes, diabetes is entirely determined by your genes and you cannot do anything to prevent it.","No, diabetes is solely caused by excessive sugar consumption, regardless of your family history.","Diabetes is a viral infection that you catch by being in contact with a sick person."
91,"What can be done to prevent diabetes and are preventive measures effective?","Adopting a healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, weight, quitting smoking/alcohol) prevents type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is prevented by medical follow-up. Type 1 is not preventable.","Taking specific vitamin supplements can prevent diabetes.","Diabetes is hereditary and cannot be prevented by lifestyle changes.","Eating a lot of sugar during childhood protects against diabetes in adulthood."
92,"How has diabetes treatment progressed in recent years?","Diabetes treatment has progressed with insulin, better blood sugar controls, new medications and technologies, but the disease is still increasing.","Diabetes is now completely cured thanks to new pills; insulin is no longer needed.","A vaccine has been found that prevents diabetes from appearing; we no longer have to worry about it.","Diabetes is no longer a serious problem because there are surgeries that cure it easily."
93,"What are the causes of diabetes?","Diabetes is an excess of sugar in the blood. Type 1 is autoimmune, type 2 is lifestyle-related, and gestational occurs during pregnancy.","Eating too much sugar directly causes diabetes.","Diabetes is caused by a virus caught in childhood.","Diabetes is solely caused by lack of exercise."

95,"how does it manifest? gangrene?","Gangrene manifests as stiffness, swelling, loss of sensation, pain, blisters/ulcers, and cold/pale skin.","It's just a bad smell in your foot that goes away with washing.","It's when your leg feels numb and tingly for a little while.","It makes your skin turn yellow like jaundice."
96,"Can a pancreas transplant cure diabetes?","Yes, a pancreas transplant can cure type 1 diabetes, but it is reserved for unstable cases or those with end-stage renal failure.","Yes, a pancreas transplant is a simple surgery that cures all types of diabetes and has no risks.","No, a pancreas transplant only slows down the progression of diabetes; it never cures it.","A pancreas transplant can cure diabetes, but only if the person follows a very strict diet for the rest of their life."
97,"What will your diet be like if you have diabetes?","Eat balanced meals, limit sugars/fats/salt, prioritize fiber/fish/turmeric/olive oil, drink water.","Eat only fruits because natural sugar is better for your body.","Completely eliminate all carbohydrates from your diet to control blood sugar.","Drink only ""diet"" drinks because they don't contain sugar."
98,"Do you ever no longer have to prick your finger to measure your blood sugar?","Yes, some diabetics use continuous sensors to measure their blood sugar without fingersticks.","Yes, it's possible if you eat very little sugar.","Yes, if diabetes is controlled by medication.","Yes, if you have a very strict diet."
99,"What is the most difficult aspect of diabetes?","The most difficult aspect of diabetes varies by person, often related to treatment constraints, symptoms, or fears of complications.","Diabetes is only a problem for elderly people and does not affect young people.","Eating a lot of sugar occasionally has no impact on diabetes if you take medication.","Diabetes can be cured by taking vitamins or natural remedies."
100,"How does diabetes affect a person's daily life and activities?","Diabetes requires blood sugar monitoring, diet, exercise, and can cause complications affecting daily life, work, and relationships.","Diabetes makes people so tired they can never exercise or go out again.","Diabetes only affects what you eat; you can live normally as long as you avoid sugar.","Diabetes is a disease that disappears if you lose enough weight."
101,"With age, does diabetes become more troublesome and difficult to treat?","Yes, diabetes can become more difficult to treat with age, increasing the risk of complications.","No, the body becomes more resistant with age and manages diabetes better.","Yes, but only because blood sugar tests become less accurate as you age.","Age has no impact on diabetes treatment; it's the initial severity that matters."
102,"I understand that two fasting values over 1.26g/dL trigger a diagnosis of type II diabetes, but will a doctor automatically put a patient on medication at this stage, or will they still give them a chance to lower these levels through diet and/or physical exercise?","The doctor may treat diabetes immediately or after a trial of diet/exercise to prevent complications.","The doctor will always immediately start a very strong medication treatment to avoid complications, as diabetes is very dangerous.","The doctor will always first ask the patient to diet and exercise for several months before considering medication.","At this stage, the patient does not yet have diabetes; it's just prediabetes, so no treatment is needed."
103,"I've read that type II diabetes can sometimes be reversed through substantial changes in diet and exercise habits. Is this true?","Yes, type 2 diabetes can be reduced or reversed through a healthy diet and exercise, improving insulin sensitivity and blood sugar.","No, once you have diabetes, you have it forever and nothing can change it.","Only if you take very expensive medication at the same time.","It's a myth; diet and exercise only help manage symptoms."
104,"If I have been diagnosed with prediabetes, can I avoid full-blown diabetes by adopting good eating habits and exercising?","Yes, you can avoid diabetes by adopting good eating habits and exercising. Prediabetes is reversible with lifestyle changes.","No, once you have prediabetes, full-blown diabetes is inevitable and lifestyle changes cannot stop it.","Maybe, but only if you start taking medication right away, as diet and exercise alone are not enough.","Yes, but only if your prediabetes is very mild; if your sugar levels are already a bit high, it's too late to reverse it."
105,"What can we do, as a community, to combat diabetes and stem its spread?","Raise awareness, encourage healthy activity/eating, screen early, and support people with diabetes to combat it.","We can wait for researchers to find a miracle cure, because prevention is too difficult for everyone.","People with diabetes should simply stop eating sugar, and the problem will be solved for everyone.","Diabetes is genetic, so there is nothing we can do as a community to stop it."
106,"What are the most important lifestyle changes for someone newly diagnosed with diabetes?","Adopt a healthy diet, exercise, monitor your blood sugar, and follow medical advice to manage your diabetes.","Eat fewer carbohydrates forever, even good carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables.","Completely avoid exercise, as it could cause dangerously low blood sugar.","Replace all meals with special diabetic meal replacements sold in pharmacies."

109,"Does ""adult-onset diabetes"" really exist? Can you become diabetic simply by gaining too much weight?","""Adult-onset diabetes"" is type 2 diabetes, often linked to overweight and lifestyle, but not only.","No, adult-onset diabetes is an old term that is no longer used because all types of diabetes are similar.","You can't become diabetic just by gaining weight; you also need to eat a lot of sugar.","Adult-onset diabetes is type 1 diabetes that appears later in life."
110,"If adult-onset diabetes is a reality, can you get rid of diabetes by losing weight, for example?","Losing weight improves type 2 diabetes control but does not cure it; medical follow-up and a healthy lifestyle remain essential.","Yes, losing a lot of weight completely eliminates diabetes and you no longer need treatment.","Losing weight means you can eat whatever you want without worrying about your blood sugar.","Adult-onset diabetes is caused solely by overweight, so by losing weight, the disease disappears."
111,"What are the first symptoms of diabetes?","Type 1 diabetes: intense thirst, frequent urination, weight loss. Type 2: often subtle, fatigue, moderate thirst. Diagnosis by blood test.","Intense muscle pain and increased sensitivity to cold are early signs of diabetes.","The first visible symptom is a red and scaly skin rash on the arms and legs.","A strong urge to eat sweets for no reason is a sign that your body is not managing sugar well."
112,"What is the most important step one can take to avoid becoming diabetic?","Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring your weight are the keys to preventing type 2 diabetes.","Avoiding all contact with people who already have diabetes, as it is a contagious disease.","Taking over-the-counter vitamins every day to strengthen the pancreas.","Drinking lots of sugary water to help the body regulate blood sugar."
113,"Does a person with diabetes live shorter than a non-diabetic person?","On average, diabetes reduces life expectancy by 10 years, but good control allows living as long as a non-diabetic.","A person with diabetes generally lives the same lifespan as a non-diabetic person.","The life expectancy of people with diabetes is only slightly lower, by a few years at most.","Diabetes has no significant impact on life expectancy if one is careful about their diet."
114,"Can the symptoms of type 2 diabetes be minimized, or completely cured, solely by changing lifestyle?","Changing lifestyle can minimize the symptoms of type 2 diabetes, but not completely cure it.","Yes, type 2 diabetes is a benign disease that completely disappears with diet and exercise.","No, type 2 diabetes always requires insulin injections, regardless of your lifestyle.","Only medication can truly treat type 2 diabetes; lifestyle changes have no significant impact."
115,"How to manage genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes?","Manage genetic risks for type 2 diabetes through regular screening and a healthy lifestyle (weight, exercise, diet, no smoking/alcohol).","You can modify your genes through specific diets or supplements.","There is nothing to be done for genetic risks, so management is not possible.","Genetic factors mean that you will develop diabetes no matter what, so lifestyle changes are useless."
116,"What are the most important changes to make to the lifestyle of a type 2 diabetic?","Weight loss, regular physical activity, and a balanced diet are key to managing type 2 diabetes.","Just taking medication is enough to control type 2 diabetes.","People with type 2 diabetes must avoid all sugar, including fruits.","Only insulin injections are effective in managing type 2 diabetes."
117,"My mother had complete liver failure not too long ago, and she was diagnosed with type II diabetes about 10 years ago. Could the liver failure have been caused by diabetes?","Yes, type 2 diabetes can cause liver failure through insulin resistance, leading to steatosis or cirrhosis.","No, diabetes only affects the pancreas and heart, not the liver.","Yes, diabetes overloads the liver with sugar, causing it to fail.","Diabetes slows down blood circulation, which can damage the liver over time."
118,"Is it possible that type II diabetes is actually type I diabetes that hasn't been diagnosed for decades?","No, type 2 and type 1 diabetes are distinct. Type 1 is autoimmune with insulin deficiency; type 2 is linked to insulin resistance and develops slowly.","Yes, type II diabetes can be undiagnosed type I for a long time because the symptoms are similar.","It's possible if the pancreas was still producing a little insulin for years before stopping.","It depends on the severity; if type I diabetes is very mild, it can resemble type II at first."
119,"Can type II diabetes be completely cured?","Type 2 diabetes is not cured, but lasting remission is possible with lifestyle changes, especially if action is taken early.","Yes, type 2 diabetes can be cured by taking medication every day.","Type 2 diabetes goes away on its own over time if you eat less sugar.","Type 2 diabetes can be cured with natural remedies like herbs or supplements."
120,"Does being diabetic mean I am more exposed to other medical problems?","Yes, poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of acute and chronic complications, affecting heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and more.","No, diabetes is just a blood sugar problem; it doesn't affect other parts of the body.","Maybe, but only if I eat a lot of sugar or if I am overweight.","Only if I take insulin, as insulin has many side effects."
121,"How often should I measure my blood sugar and what should I do if it is too high or too low?","Measure blood sugar according to your type of diabetes. In case of hypoglycemia, consume fast-acting carbohydrates. In case of hyperglycemia, identify the cause and consult your healthcare team.","I can measure my blood sugar once a week if I feel well, and I don't need to do anything if it's a bit high or low.","I must always measure my blood sugar before each meal, and if it's too high, I can simply drink a lot of water to lower it.","Measurement frequency does not depend on the type of diabetes, and if my blood sugar is too low, I must take more insulin."
122,"Are there any new medications that I could use to manage my diabetes?","New injectable medications for type 2 diabetes are in development, improving insulin, weight, and blood sugar.","Yes, there are new pills that can completely cure diabetes; you just need to take one a day.","They have developed a very strict new diet that replaces the need for diabetes medication.","There is a new cream to apply to the skin that lowers blood sugar instantly."

124,"Does diabetes directly cause or increase the risk of other serious diseases?","Yes, diabetes increases the risk of heart, kidney, nerve, and eye diseases by damaging blood vessels.","Diabetes does not cause serious illnesses; it just makes people more tired.","Diabetes only affects blood sugar; it has no impact on other organs in the body.","Diabetes is only dangerous if you eat a lot of sugar; otherwise, there is no risk of complications."
125,"Is there a genetic predisposition to diabetes? Or is it purely a matter of diet?","Yes, there is a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes, but diet and lifestyle also play a major role.","Diabetes is always caused by a poor diet; genetics plays no role.","Only obese people can develop diabetes, so genetics is irrelevant.","Diabetes is purely a hereditary disease; the way you live has no influence."
126,"Will diabetes one day be ""cured""?","Diabetes is chronic, not curable but controllable. Weight loss can reverse type 2, but the disease persists.","Yes, most cases of diabetes can be cured with natural remedies or food supplements.","Diabetes generally disappears on its own after a few years if you are careful about your diet.","There is already a vaccine that cures type 1 diabetes."
127,"Are there any natural remedies for diabetes that have shown promise?","Some plants like berberine, cinnamon, or turmeric show potential to help manage blood sugar, but medical follow-up remains essential.","Eating a lot of sugar can cure diabetes by getting the body used to large amounts.","Diabetes can be cured by completely stopping eating for a few days.","Drinking only water and fresh fruit juices can reverse diabetes."
128,"Is diabetes curable? In other words, can one get rid of diabetes completely without any lingering effects? Or is it a disease that one must live with?","Diabetes is generally not curable, but it can be effectively controlled through treatment and lifestyle.","Yes, you just need to eat less sugar and diabetes disappears.","Diabetes is completely cured with medicinal plants and natural remedies.","Diabetes is not a real disease; it's just a blood sugar problem that is easily fixed."
129,"Are there ways to know if you are predisposed to diabetes even if you don't know if your family has a history of diabetes?","Consult your doctor for blood tests (fasting blood sugar, HbA1c) to confirm diabetes. Symptoms and risk factors (age, overweight) can alert you.","You can tell by seeing if you have a lot of freckles, as this is a genetic sign.","You just need to do a urine test at home to see if there is sugar in it.","If you eat a lot of sugar and don't gain weight, it means you are predisposed."
130,"What are the best ways to prevent diabetes?","Prevent diabetes through physical activity, weight loss, balanced diet (low GI, fruits/vegetables, fish), quitting smoking, and regular blood sugar monitoring.","Drinking a lot of sugary water to dilute the sugar in the blood.","Avoiding eating altogether to avoid increasing your blood sugar.","Taking special vitamins sold in pharmacies that block sugar absorption."
131,"Are there variations in the severity of diabetes and what determines the severity?","The severity of diabetes varies depending on the type, blood sugar, complications, and individual factors like age and lifestyle.","No, diabetes is always the same serious disease for everyone.","The severity of diabetes depends solely on the amount of sugar you eat.","The severity of diabetes is the same for everyone, but the symptoms vary."
132,"Is diabetes genetic and what is the probability of a child getting it if one parent has it?","Diabetes is genetic. The risk for the child is 5% for type 1 and up to 70% for type 2 if both parents are affected.","Yes, diabetes is always genetic, so the child will surely get it if a parent has it.","No, diabetes is not genetic; it is solely caused by a poor diet.","The probability is the same for all types of diabetes, about 50%, because it's fifty-fifty."
133,"What are the main differences in severity and symptoms between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?","Type 1: autoimmune, young people, sudden symptoms, insulin. Type 2: resistance, elderly/overweight, asymptomatic/complications, hygiene/medication.","Type 1 diabetes is simply a more severe version of type 2 diabetes, appearing earlier in life.","The main difference is that type 1 diabetes always requires insulin injections, while type 2 can be controlled by diet alone.","Type 2 diabetes is caused by excessive sugar consumption, while type 1 is a genetic disease."
134,"What can I do to avoid getting either type of diabetes and what symptoms should I watch out for?","Healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, stress, smoking) and weight/blood sugar control prevent diabetes. Symptoms: thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, weight loss, infections, blurry visio...","You just need to eat less sugar and you won't get it; the symptoms are just severe fatigue.","Diabetes is genetic; there's nothing you can do to avoid it; you just need to be careful when you feel weak.","You need to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and avoid intense sport; the symptoms are being very hungry all the time."
135,"COULD INSULIN AFFECT MY SKIN?","Yes, insulin can affect the skin (dents/lumps). Change your needle and examine your skin regularly.","No, insulin only affects blood sugar, not the skin.","Yes, insulin can make the skin dry and flaky all over the body.","Insulin makes the skin more sensitive to the sun and sunburn."
136,"Can insulin injections CAUSE SKIN RASHES?","Yes, insulin injections can cause skin rashes (allergy, infection, etc.). Change the site and consult a doctor if persistent.","No, insulin is a natural medication produced by the body so it cannot cause reactions.","Only if you are allergic to mosquito bites, as the needle is similar.","Yes, if you don't disinfect your skin with strong alcohol before injecting."
137,"Can insulin injections CAUSE ALLERGIES TO VARIOUS PRODUCTS?","Insulin can cause local/generalized allergies, but not directly to other products.","Yes, insulin modifies the immune system, making people more sensitive to food allergies.","Yes, insulin contains traces of many known allergens that can cause reactions to other products.","No, insulin has no link with allergies to other products; it is diabetes itself that causes allergies."
138,"WHAT CAN HELP MY DIABETES?","Follow your doctor's advice, take your medication, monitor your blood sugar, eat healthily, and exercise.","Eating a lot of sugar so your body gets used to it and stops reacting.","Completely avoiding carbohydrates, even those that are good for your health.","Drinking diet sodas to compensate for sugars."
139,"HOW TO EASILY MANAGE BLOOD SUGAR?","Manage your blood sugar by monitoring it, eating balanced meals (less sugar/fat, more fiber/complex carbohydrates), drinking water, and exercising.","Eat less so the body doesn't need to produce as much sugar.","Drink sugary drinks because sugar helps balance sugar in the blood.","Take heart medication because diabetes affects the heart."
140,"Why does my blood sugar increase DESPITE ADEQUATE INSULIN INTAKE?","Your blood sugar can increase despite insulin due to diet, stress, infection, or medications. Consult a doctor if hyperglycemia persists.","The insulin is expired or of poor quality, making it ineffective.","Your body is getting used to insulin and needs more to function.","You ate too much sugar the day before, and it still affects your blood sugar."
141,"Why does my blood sugar increase DESPITE a BALANCED DIET?","Your blood sugar may increase despite a balanced diet due to lack of insulin, stress, infection, or certain medications. Consult your doctor.","Eating too much fruit, even healthy fruit, can raise blood sugar.","Skipping meals causes the body to store more sugar when you eat.","Drinking sugary water unknowingly in ""sugar-free"" drinks can be the cause."
142,"IN THE FUTURE, IS IT POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER A TREATMENT OTHER THAN INJECTION, FOR EXAMPLE INSULIN PATCHES?","Yes, insulin patches exist (approved patch pumps) and needle-free patches are being researched, but not yet available.","Yes, there are already insulin patches sold in pharmacies without a prescription, like patches for type 2 diabetes.","Insulin patches are in development but they cannot replace injections because they don't dose insulin correctly.","Insulin cannot pass through the skin, so patches will never be an option for administering insulin."
143,"WHY IS IT GETTING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL MY BLOOD SUGAR WITH AGE?","Your blood sugar can increase with age due to factors like heredity, stress, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity, promoting type 2 diabetes.","It's just normal for your body to slow down, like an old car.","Your cells are becoming less good at using insulin because they are tired.","Eating less sugar is no longer enough as you get older."
144,"Does taking other MEDICATIONS have an impact ON MY DIABETES CONTROL?","Yes, other medications can affect your blood sugar. Always consult your doctor before taking a new medication.","No, medications for other illnesses do not act on diabetes; they treat different problems in the body.","Only if the medications are for a heart condition, as the heart and diabetes are linked.","It depends on the color of the medication; red medications affect blood sugar levels more."
145,"MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DIET for people with diabetes?","A balanced diet, rich in fiber, antioxidants, and omega-3, with 3 regular meals, is key for diabetics. Prioritize vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fatty fish, etc.","People with diabetes must avoid all sugars, even those present in fruits.","Eating only two large meals a day helps to better control blood sugar.","It is most important to eat ""sugar-free"" foods even if they are very fatty or salty."
146,"What is the EFFECT of diabetes on the EYES?","Diabetes can damage the retina, vitreous humor, or optic nerve, thus affecting vision.","Diabetes discolors the eyes, making them yellow or red.","Diabetes causes the eyes to swell and makes them more sensitive to light.","Diabetes can make the eyes shrink and cause blurry vision."
147,"ARE THERE NEW TREATMENTS AVAILABLE for diabetes?","Yes, new treatments include tirzepatide, bariatric surgery, artificial pancreas, Eversense sensor, and SGLT2 inhibitors.","The only new thing is insulin in pills, which replaces injections.","New treatments are limited to very strict diets designed by artificial intelligence.","There is now a vaccine that prevents diabetes."
148,"IS LIFESTYLE OR DIET THE MAIN FACTOR HELPING TREATMENT?","Yes, lifestyle and diet are essential for treating diabetes.","No, medication is the only way to effectively treat diabetes.","No, only regular physical exercise has a significant impact on treatment.","No, lifestyle has only a minor impact compared to genetics."
