[DIABETES HISTORY]
The history of diabetes mellitus dates back over 3500 years, with polyuric diseases being described in ancient times. The name "diabetes" comes from the Greek word for a syphon, and the sweet taste of diabetic urine was recognized at the beginning of the first millennium. The adjective "mellitus" (honeyed) was added by Rollo in the late 18th century.

----
[EARLY DIABETES RESEARCH]
In the 19th century, researchers such as Chevreul, Bernard, and Laguesse made significant contributions to the understanding of diabetes, including the identification of glucose in diabetic urine and the role of the pancreas in glucose metabolism. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Banting, Best, Macleod, and Collip was a major milestone in the treatment of diabetes.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes was initially subdivided into two types: diabète maigre (lean subjects) and diabète gras (obese) by Lancereaux in 1880. Later, Falta and Himsworth classified diabetes into insulin-sensitive and insulin-insensitive types, which laid the foundation for the modern classification of type 1 (insulin-dependent) and type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.

----
[INSULIN AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Insulin resistance and β-cell failure are the fundamental defects of type 2 diabetes, and researchers such as Andres and DeFronzo have developed techniques to measure insulin action. The "insulin clamp" method has been instrumental in understanding insulin resistance, and maturity-onset diabetes of the young was described as a distinct variant of type 2 diabetes by Tattersall in 1974.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
The various types of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy have been described over the years, with significant contributions from researchers such as Kimmelstiel and Wilson. The concept of a specific diabetic angiopathy was developed by Lundbaek in the early 1950s, and improved glucose control has been shown to be beneficial in preventing complications.

----
[TREATMENT ADVANCES]
Milestones in insulin pharmacology include the invention of delayed-action preparations, synthetic human insulin, and novel insulin analogs. Oral hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas and biguanides have also been developed, and landmark studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study have demonstrated the importance of improved glucose control in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

[EARLY DESCRIPTIONS OF DIABETES]
The Ebers papyrus, an ancient Egyptian medical text, describes diabetes as a "melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine" with symptoms including excessive thirst, urination, and a short, unpleasant life. This description dates back to around 1500 BC. The papyrus notes that patients with diabetes have an incessant flow of urine, despite drinking large quantities of water. This early description highlights the severe symptoms associated with untreated diabetes.

----
[HISTORICAL MILESTONES IN DIABETES DESCRIPTION]
Historical figures such as Sushrut, Charak, and Aretaeus of Cappadocia have contributed to the clinical descriptions of diabetes, noting symptoms like polyuric state, sugary urine, and distinguishing between thin and obese patients. These descriptions, spanning from 500 BC to the 2nd century AD, demonstrate the early understanding of diabetes and its complications. The naming of the condition as "diabetes" is attributed to Aretaeus of Cappadocia.

----
[EARLY RECOGNITION OF DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Ancient and medieval physicians, including Avicenna and Chen Chuan, recognized complications of diabetes such as gangrene, impotence, and sugary urine. Later, physicians like William Prout, Adolf Kussmaul, and Albert Heyl described additional complications, including diabetic coma, acidotic breathing, and lipemia retinalis. These early observations laid the foundation for understanding the range of complications associated with diabetes.

----
[DEVELOPMENT OF DIABETES CLASSIFICATION AND COMPLICATIONS]
The classification of diabetes lesions and the recognition of specific complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, have evolved over time. Physicians like Eduard von Jaeger, Stephen Mackenzie, and Edward Nettleship contributed to the understanding of retinopathy, while John Rollo, Marchal de Calvi, and Frederick Pavy described neuropathic symptoms and peripheral neuropathy. The work of these physicians has helped shape our current understanding of diabetes and its complications.

[EARLY RECOGNITION OF DIABETES]
The Hindu physicians, Charak and Sushrut, are believed to be among the first to recognize the sweetness of diabetic urine, making diagnoses by tasting the urine or noting that ants congregated around it. They also noted that the disease was prevalent in individuals who were indolent, overweight, and gluttonous, and who consumed sweet and fatty foods. Physical exercise and a diet rich in vegetables were recommended as treatment for the obese, while lean individuals were given a nourishing diet.

----
[HISTORICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF DIABETES]
In the 17th and 18th centuries, European physicians such as Thomas Willis wrote about diabetes, describing the urine as "wonderfully sweet like sugar or honey". However, it wasn't until Matthew Dobson's paper in 1776 that the first description of hyperglycemia was published, where he found that both the serum and urine of his patient tasted sweet and contained sugar. Dobson concluded that the kidneys excreted sugar and that it was not formed in the secretory organ but previously existed in the serum of the blood.

----
[EVOLUTION OF DIABETES TREATMENT]
The Edinburgh-trained surgeon, John Rollo, applied the adjective "mellitus" to diabetes and developed the "animal diet" which became the standard treatment for most of the 19th century. Rollo thought that sugar was formed in the stomach, and his work built upon the discoveries of earlier physicians such as Dobson. The understanding of diabetes and its treatment continued to evolve over time, with contributions from various physicians and researchers.

[EARLY DIAGNOSTIC METHODS]
The measurement of blood glucose was first introduced by Trommer in 1841, Moore in 1844, and Fehling in 1848, but it was a rare practice due to the large amount of blood required. The introduction of a micromethod by Ivar Christian Bang in 1913 made it more practicable, leading to the development of the glucose tolerance test between 1913 and 1915. This advancement in diagnostic methods marked a significant milestone in the history of diabetes care.

----
[HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING OF GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Claude Bernard's work in the 19th century clarified glucose metabolism, disproving the prevailing theory that sugar could only be synthesized by plants. He discovered that glucose was present in the blood of normal animals, even when starved, and found higher concentrations of glucose in the hepatic vein than in the portal vein. Bernard's findings laid the foundation for a deeper understanding of glucose metabolism and its role in diabetes.

----
[EARLY TREATMENT APPROACHES]
In the late 18th century, John Rollo recommended a diet of animal food, including game, old meats, and fat, for patients with diabetes. However, he noted that some patients struggled to adhere to this treatment regimen, highlighting the challenge of non-compliance in diabetes management. Rollo's work marked one of the earliest attempts to develop a treatment approach for diabetes, although it was based on limited understanding of the disease at the time.

----
[IDENTIFICATION OF GLUCOSE IN DIABETIC URINE]
In 1815, the French chemist Michel Chevreul proved that the sugar in diabetic urine was glucose, marking an important milestone in the understanding of diabetes. This discovery led to the development of chemical tests for reducing agents such as glucose, replacing the earlier practice of tasting urine to make a diagnosis.

[EARLY UNDERSTANDING OF DIABETES]
The concept of internal secretions, which was publicized by Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard in 1889, played a significant role in understanding the role of the pancreas in diabetes. This concept was further supported by Murray's report in 1891 that myxoedema could be cured by sheep thyroid extract. The idea of internal secretions led to the discovery of the pancreas' role in producing a glucose-lowering secretion. The term "insuline" was coined by Jean de Meyer in 1909 to describe this hypothetical secretion.

----
[DISCOVERY OF THE PANCREAS' ROLE IN DIABETES]
Oskar Minkowski and Josef von Mering's experiment in 1889, which involved pancreatectomy in dogs, led to the discovery of the pancreas' role in diabetes. The experiment caused severe diabetes in the dogs, and Minkowski realized the significance of polyuria, a symptom of diabetes. This breakthrough marked the beginning of understanding the pancreatic origin of diabetes. However, it took several decades for the concept to gain widespread acceptance.

----
[HISTORICAL THEORIES OF DIABETES]
In the 19th century, various theories emerged to explain the cause of diabetes, including the "glycogenic" theory proposed by Bernard. This theory suggested that sugar absorbed from the intestine was converted into glycogen in the liver and released into the blood during fasting. Another theory proposed that nervous influences played a significant role in causing diabetes, with some researchers citing the higher incidence of diabetes among engine drivers as evidence.

----
[DISCOVERY OF THE ISLETS OF LANGERHANS]
In 1869, Paul Langerhans discovered clusters of cells in the pancreas, which were later named the "islets of Langerhans" by Gustave Laguesse. Laguesse suggested that these cells produced the putative internal secretion of the pancreas, which was later found to be insulin. The discovery of the islets of Langerhans was a crucial step in understanding the pancreatic origin of diabetes and the role of insulin in glucose regulation.

[DIABETES HISTORICAL CONTEXT]
The understanding of diabetes and its complications has evolved over time, with key contributions from various physicians in the 19th century. Stephen Mackenzie and Sir Edward Nettleship discovered microaneurysms in the retina in 1879, while Julius Hirschberg described the full picture of diabetic retinopathy in 1890. These findings laid the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY DESCRIPTION]
Diabetic retinopathy was first described by Eduard von Jaeger in his Atlas of Diseases of the Ocular Fundus in 1869, although it was not specifically linked to diabetes at that time. The condition was later described in more detail by Julius Hirschberg in 1890, who claimed it was specific to diabetes. The features of diabetic retinopathy were illustrated in Jaeger's atlas, including microaneurysms and new vessels in the retina.

----
[NEUROPATHIC SYMPTOMS IN DIABETES]
Neuropathic symptoms in patients with diabetes were first mentioned by Rollo at the end of the 18th century, and later described in detail by Charles Marchal de Calvi in 1864 and Frederick Pavy in 1885. These symptoms were recognized as a specific complication of diabetes, highlighting the importance of nerve damage in the disease.

----
[19TH CENTURY DIABETES TREATMENT]
In the 19th century, doctors were largely unable to treat diabetes effectively, and their role was mainly limited to describing symptom complexes and the natural history of the disease. As a result, many of the major complications of diabetes were well described before 1900, despite the lack of effective treatments.
