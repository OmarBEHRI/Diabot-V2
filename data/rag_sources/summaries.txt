These innovative approaches aim to improve glycemic control, reduce complications, and enhance the quality of life for individuals with diabetes. Ongoing research and development are critical to advancing diabetes care.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES AUTOANTIBODIES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies, which are antibodies that target the body's own tissues. Insulin autoantibodies are a type of autoantibody that can be detected in people with type 1 diabetes, and their presence can be used to predict the risk of developing the disease. Research has also identified other autoantibodies associated with type 1 diabetes, such as IA-2 and GAD65.

----
[GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Genetic factors play a significant role in the development of type 1 diabetes, with certain genetic markers such as HLA-DQB1*0602 and HLA-DQA1*0102 conferring susceptibility to the disease. The presence of these genetic markers can be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN AUTOANTIBODY CORRELATES]
Insulin autoantibodies have been found to be correlated with the age of onset of type 1 diabetes, with higher levels of autoantibodies detected in younger individuals. Additionally, the presence of insulin autoantibodies has been found to be a poor predictor of clinical course and antibody response to exogenous insulin.

----
[NEW ANTIGENIC TARGETS IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Research has identified new antigenic targets in type 1 diabetes, including ZnT8 and SOX13. These targets may play a role in the autoimmune response that characterizes type 1 diabetes, and may be useful in the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

----
[EARLY PHASES OF AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE]
The early phases of autoimmune response in type 1 diabetes are marked by the presence of autoantibodies to specific antigens, including GAD65, IA2, and glima 38. These autoantibodies can be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes, and may be useful in the development of preventive therapies.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disease with pancreatic β-cell destruction, typically presenting at a young age with diabetic ketoacidosis requiring continuous insulin treatment. Patients with type 1 diabetes often carry autoimmune markers such as antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). However, there are other types of diabetes with a type 1 phenotype, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA).

----
[DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS]
Autoantibodies to various islet cell antigens, such as GAD, ICA-512, and GLUT-2, can be detected in patients with type 1 diabetes. These autoantibodies can serve as diagnostic markers to distinguish type 1 diabetes from other forms of diabetes. The presence of these markers can also indicate a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes.

----
[ETHNIC DIFFERENCES]
There are significant ethnic differences in the presentation and natural progression of type 1 diabetes. In Caucasian populations, over 90% of patients diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 35 have type 1 disease, whereas in non-Caucasian populations, autoimmune type 1 diabetes is less common. For example, in Hong Kong, less than 10% of adults presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis have autoimmune markers.

----
[CLINICAL IMPORTANCE]
The correct diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and other disorders with a type 1 phenotype is crucial due to their different clinical courses, prognoses, and management strategies. Accurate diagnosis can help guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.
----
[MONOGENIC DIABETES]
Monogenic diabetes is caused by genetic mutations encoding pathways implicated in insulin synthesis and secretion, leading to young-onset diabetes with atypical presentation. This type of diabetes may exhibit a mixed phenotype, including young age of diagnosis, insulinopenia, and normal body weight, with a non-ketotic state typical of type 2 diabetes. Monogenic diabetes can be associated with a parental history of diabetes, particularly maternal history. The prevalence of parental history of diabetes is higher in young Chinese patients with diabetes, ranging from 32-47%.

----
[MODY SUBTYPES]
Several subtypes of Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) have been reported, including MODY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, each caused by mutations in different transcription factors. These transcription factors have key roles in pancreatic development, including differentiation and proliferation of β-cells. The frequencies of HNF-1α mutations vary among different populations, ranging from 25-50% in French patients to 5% in Chinese patients.

----
[ATYPICAL DIABETES PRESENTATION]
Atypical diabetes can present with heterogeneous etiologies, including young-onset diabetes with acute ketotic presentation, which may not require insulin and can follow a clinical course resembling type 2 diabetes. This presentation is often seen in African-American and Asian patients, who may not have HLA genotypes or autoantibodies typical of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Obesity, insulin resistance, and glucotoxicity can contribute to the initial ketotic presentation in these patients.

----
[GENETIC MUTATIONS AND DIABETES RISK]
Genetic mutations in transcription factors, such as HNF-1α, HNF-4α, and HNF-1β, can increase the risk of diabetes or metabolic traits, which may interact with other genetic or environmental and/or lifestyle factors to give rise to overt diabetes. Common polymorphisms of these transcription factors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetes or metabolic traits. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors can lead to the development of diabetes in susceptible individuals.
----
[GENETIC FORMS OF DIABETES]
MODY (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young) is a form of diabetes that is caused by genetic mutations, with several subtypes including MODY 1, MODY 2, MODY 3, MODY 4, MODY 5, and MODY 6, each associated with specific genetic defects. These defects affect the function of pancreatic beta cells, leading to impaired insulin secretion. The genetic mutations involved in MODY affect various transcription factors, including HNF-1α, HNF-1β, and HNF-4α, which play crucial roles in the development and function of pancreatic islet cells.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Insulin secretion is a critical process by which pancreatic beta cells release insulin in response to elevated glucose levels, allowing for glucose uptake and energy production or storage. This process involves the co-secretion of amylin, a hormone that helps regulate glucose metabolism. The glucose transporter GLUT-2 plays a key role in glucose sensing and insulin secretion, highlighting the importance of glucose metabolism in the regulation of insulin release.

----
[TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS IN PANCREATIC DEVELOPMENT]
The development and maturation of pancreatic islet cells and beta cells involve a complex interplay of transcription factors, including IPF-1, Islet-1, Pax4, Pax6, Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, and NeuroD1/BETA2. These transcription factors regulate the expression of target genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin secretion, and cell differentiation, highlighting the importance of transcriptional regulation in pancreatic development and function. Dysregulation of these transcription factors can lead to impaired pancreatic function and diabetes.
----
[DIABETES TYPES AND GENETICS]
Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) includes subtypes with mutations in transcription factors, such as HNF-4α, HNF-1α, and insulin promotion factor (IPF-1). These mutations affect the development and function of pancreatic β-cells, leading to impaired insulin secretion. MODY is a form of diabetes that typically develops in young adulthood and is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION AND REGULATION]
The regulation of insulin secretion involves multiple steps, including the sensing of ambient blood glucose levels by GLUT-2, glycolysis by glucokinase, and ATP production by mitochondria. This process ultimately leads to the translocation of insulin-containing vesicles to the cellular surface for extracytosis. Transcription factors are also activated, resulting in insulin gene transcription and production to replenish insulin-containing vesicles and maintain continuous insulin secretion.

----
[MITOCHONDRIAL DNA MUTATIONS AND DIABETES]
Mitochondrial DNA mutations, such as the A3243G mutation, have been associated with an increased risk of diabetes, particularly in patients with a maternal inheritance pattern. Other point mutations and deletions in mitochondrial DNA have also been linked to an increased risk of diabetes. These mutations can affect the function of pancreatic β-cells and contribute to the development of diabetes.

----
[AMYLIN AND DIABETES]
Amylin, a 37 amino acid polypeptide, is co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells and is the principal constituent of amyloid deposits in the islets of Langerhans in type 2 diabetes. The formation of intracellular islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) oligomers may contribute to pancreatic β-cell loss and progressive hyperglycemia. Genetic variants encoding proteins involved in amylin metabolism may lead to structural changes of amylin and increased oligomerization, resulting in β-cell death.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF LADA]
The correct diagnosis of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) is crucial, as early use of insulin instead of sulphonylurea may prevent or reduce the rate of deterioration of β-cell function in young patients with diabetes. Impaired β-cell response is evident at diagnosis, and early use of insulin may reduce the adverse effects of glucotoxicity on β-cells. High clinical suspicion and HLA studies can distinguish LADA from classic Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).
----
[SUBTYPES OF DIABETES WITH TYPE 1 PHENOTYPE]
In Japan and Korea, fulminant T1DM has been reported in both young and old patients, characterized by absence of insulitis, negative autoantibodies, low C peptide levels, and elevated pancreatic enzyme concentrations. In India, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in youth often overlaps with monogenic forms of diabetes, fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes, and diabetes associated with malnourishment, which are ketosis-resistant forms of youth-onset diabetes.
----
[PATHOGENESIS OF DIABETES]
The pathogenesis of diabetes involves genetic or acquired factors that affect pancreatic β-cell structure and function, as well as associated mechanisms such as amylin deposition and mitochondrial damage. This can give rise to a broad range of clinical manifestations with considerable overlap between Type 1 and Type 2 phenotypes. A detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing can help clinicians refine the diagnosis and guide treatment.
----
[GENETIC MUTATIONS AFFECTING PANCREATIC β-CELL FUNCTION]
Genetic variants of transcription factors implicated in pancreatic β-cell development, structure, and function have been reported in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) play an important regulatory role in insulin secretion, and genetic variants encoding the KATP channels subunits are associated with reduced insulin secretion and diabetes in different ethnic populations.
----
[DIABETES TYPES AND GENETICS]
Type 1 diabetes is associated with an increased frequency of human leukocyte antigen DR3 and DR4, while Type 2 diabetes has been linked to various genetic mutations, including those in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene. Research has identified several novel mutations in this gene associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). These genetic factors can contribute to the development of diabetes, particularly in certain populations.

----
[DIABETES RESEARCH STUDIES]
Several studies have investigated the genetic and clinical characteristics of diabetes in different populations, including Chinese and Finnish cohorts. These studies have provided insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying Type 2 diabetes and MODY, and have identified potential mutational hotspots in certain genes. The research has also highlighted the importance of considering genetic factors in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes.

----
[GENETIC MUTATIONS AND DIABETES]
Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene have been identified as a common cause of MODY, a form of diabetes that typically develops at a young age. These mutations can affect the function of the gene, leading to impaired insulin secretion and the development of diabetes. The identification of these mutations can help with the diagnosis and treatment of MODY, and may also provide insights into the development of Type 2 diabetes.

----
[POPULATION-SPECIFIC DIABETES RISK]
Certain populations, such as Chinese and Asian Indian cohorts, may be at higher risk of developing diabetes due to genetic and environmental factors. Research has shown that these populations may have a higher prevalence of certain genetic mutations associated with diabetes, and may also be more likely to develop vascular disease and other complications. Understanding these population-specific risk factors can help with the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies.
----
[ISLET AMYLOID AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Islet amyloid, a complication of islet dysfunction, has been linked to Type 2 diabetes. Research suggests that islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) gene mutations, such as the S20G mutation, may be associated with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that this mutation can lead to increased in vitro amyloidogenicity and intracellular cytotoxicity compared to wild-type amylin.

----
[AMYLIN GENE MUTATIONS AND DIABETES RISK]
Amylin gene promoter mutations, such as the S20G mutation, have been found to predispose individuals to Type 2 diabetes in various populations, including Japanese, Chinese, and New Zealand Maori. These mutations can affect insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism, contributing to the development of Type 2 diabetes.

----
[SULFONYLUREA RECEPTOR GENE AND DIABETES]
The sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes. Sequence variants in the SUR gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in Caucasians. However, other studies have found no association between certain SUR gene variants and Type 2 diabetes risk, highlighting the complexity of the relationship between genetic factors and diabetes.

----
[GENETIC STUDIES AND DIABETES]
Genetic studies have identified several genes involved in pancreatic beta-cell function that may contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes. Variants in genes such as SUR1 and Kir6.2 have been associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, although the relationships between these genes and diabetes risk are not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIABETES TYPES AND CLASSIFICATION]
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, and there are also other forms of diabetes, such as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and latent autoimmune diabetes mellitus in children (LADC), which have distinct characteristics and diagnostic criteria. The classification and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus have been defined and reported by various organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Diabetes Association. These classifications help healthcare professionals to accurately diagnose and manage different types of diabetes.

----
[RESEARCH ON LATENT AUTOIMMUNE DIABETES]
Research studies have investigated the concept of latent autoimmune diabetes, including its prevalence, characteristics, and diagnostic criteria. For example, studies have shown that LADA should be considered a distinct form of diabetes, and that it may be more common than previously thought. Other studies have explored the relationship between latent autoimmune diabetes and other autoimmune conditions, such as autoimmune thyroiditis and celiac disease.

----
[GENETIC FACTORS IN DIABETES]
Genetic factors play a significant role in the development of diabetes, and research has identified several genetic variants that contribute to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. For example, polymorphisms in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes have been associated with glucose intolerance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Other studies have investigated the genetic factors that contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, including the role of HLA-DQ genotypes.

----
[REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN DIABETES PREVALENCE]
There are regional variations in the prevalence of different types of diabetes, with some forms being more common in certain populations. For example, fulminant type 1 diabetes has been reported to be more common in Asian populations, while type 2 diabetes is increasingly prevalent in Indian and other South Asian populations. Understanding these regional variations can help healthcare professionals to develop targeted prevention and treatment strategies.

----
[DIABETES PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
Research has also explored the pathophysiology of diabetes, including the role of beta-cell dysfunction and alpha-cell expansion in the development of type 2 diabetes. Other studies have investigated the relationship between islet amyloid load and the development of type 2 diabetes, as well as the role of neurogenic differentiation and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha genes in glucose intolerance.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS OVERVIEW]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous disorder caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors that affect β-cell function and tissue insulin sensitivity. About 10% of patients with T2DM have a late-onset form of autoimmune diabetes, while up to 5% have autosomal dominantly inherited forms. The remaining 85% of patients have "garden variety" T2DM, which is a polygenic disorder. Genetic factors primarily affect β-cell function, whereas acquired factors, such as obesity and physical inactivity, contribute to insulin resistance.
----
[β-CELL FUNCTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Impaired β-cell function can be detected in genetically predisposed individuals, even when they have normal glucose tolerance and normal tissue insulin sensitivity. T2DM develops due to a progressive deterioration in β-cell function, coupled with acquired insulin resistance, which the β-cell cannot compensate for. At the time of diagnosis, β-cell function is already reduced by about 50%, and most defects are already present in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION ABNORMALITIES]
Commonly found insulin secretion abnormalities in T2DM include absent first-phase and diminished second-phase release, reduced responses to mixed meals and non-glucose stimuli, and a decrease in maximal secretory capacity. The secretory pulses are smaller and less regular, and the ratio of proinsulin to insulin release is elevated. These abnormalities contribute to the development of T2DM.
----
[ACQUIRED FACTORS AND β-CELL FUNCTION]
Acquired factors, such as hyperglycemia, increased plasma free fatty acids, and alterations in incretins, can adversely affect β-cell function and contribute to the development of T2DM. Additionally, malnutrition in utero and early life may affect β-cell programming, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis and interleukin-1β effects on β-cell function are also being studied for their role in T2DM pathogenesis.
----
[PATHOLOGIC FEATURES OF T2DM]
A pathologic feature present in 90% of patients with T2DM is the abnormal extracellular deposits of islet amyloid, composed of insoluble fibrils formed from the protein islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Other histologic changes include a 30-50% decrease in islet mass and an alteration in the relative proportion of the islet cell population. However, the IAPP and its amyloid deposits have not been clearly found to be cytotoxic to β-cells.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION ABNORMALITIES]
Abnormalities in insulin secretion, particularly late hyperinsulinemia, are observed in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Restoration of early insulin responses can reduce late hyperinsulinemia. The plasma glucose concentration is a major factor regulating insulin secretion, and other factors such as amino acids, free fatty acids, and gastrointestinal hormones can also augment insulin secretion.

----
[INSULIN REGULATION]
The prevailing plasma glucose concentration is crucial in determining whether the plasma insulin concentration is appropriate. For example, an individual with diabetes may have a higher plasma insulin level than someone without diabetes, but it may still be inappropriate given their hyperglycemic state. The gold standard for assessing β-cell function is the hyperglycemic clamp, as it provides a standardized stimulus for insulin release and allows for evaluation of both phases of insulin release.

----
[β-CELL FUNCTION VS INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The common form of T2DM results from a combination of genetic and acquired factors that affect β-cell function and tissue insulin sensitivity. Recent evidence suggests that impaired β-cell function is the primary underlying defect, rather than insulin resistance. This concept has evolved over time, with earlier studies suggesting that insulin resistance was the primary defect, but more recent studies have swung the pendulum in favor of impaired β-cell function as the primary genetic defect.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE HISTORY]
The idea that insulin resistance could be the primary defect in diabetes dates back to classic studies by Himsworth and Kerr over 60 years ago. These studies demonstrated that lean patients with early-onset diabetes were sensitive to exogenous insulin, while obese patients with late-onset diabetes were resistant. Later studies measuring plasma insulin levels in patients with T2DM found that they had higher-than-normal values in the fasting and postprandial state, providing further evidence for insulin resistance.
----
[DIABETES PATHOGENESIS]
The pathogenesis of diabetes involves a gradual deterioration of β-cell function, which is responsible for insulin production. In genetically predisposed individuals, impaired β-cell function can be demonstrated even when no insulin resistance is apparent. As insulin resistance emerges, usually due to unhealthy lifestyles, β-cell function increases to compensate, but eventually, β-cell function deteriorates, leading to abnormal glucose tolerance.

----
[β-CELL FUNCTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The relationship between β-cell function and insulin sensitivity is hyperbolic, meaning that as tissue insulin sensitivity decreases, β-cell function increases to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. This adaptation allows the body to maintain normal glucose levels despite insulin resistance, but it can eventually lead to β-cell exhaustion and diabetes.

----
[STAGES OF TYPE 2 DIABETES DEVELOPMENT]
Individuals destined to develop type 2 diabetes typically pass through five stages, starting from birth with normal glucose homeostasis but genetic predisposition to diabetes. The stages progress from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance and eventually to type 2 diabetes, with decreasing insulin sensitivity and β-cell function at each stage.

----
[β-CELL FUNCTION ASSESSMENT]
Assessing β-cell function requires consideration of the individual's insulin sensitivity, as β-cell function increases to compensate for insulin resistance. The prevailing stimulus for insulin secretion, such as plasma glucose concentration, must also be taken into account to determine the appropriateness of β-cell function.

----
[ROLE OF β-CELL DEFECTS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
β-cell defects play a crucial role in the natural history of type 2 diabetes, with longitudinal and cross-sectional studies indicating that most individuals destined to develop type 2 diabetes pass through the five stages of glucose intolerance, from normal glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION PROCESS]
Insulin secretion is dependent on glucose entry in the β-cell and its metabolism, synthesis of insulin and insulin granules, and other proteins necessary for moving granules toward the β-cell membrane. The insulin secretion pattern is pulsatile, undergoing short and long oscillations, with rapid oscillations corresponding to serial secretory insulin bursts every 5-15 minutes. These high-frequency bursts account for the majority of insulin secreted in humans.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION PATTERNS]
The insulin secretion pattern throughout the day is more complicated than that seen during acute hyperglycemia in hyperglycemic clamp experiments. In vivo insulin secretion is pulsatile, with rapid oscillations corresponding to serial secretory insulin bursts, and long oscillations that are still poorly understood. The integrity of these responses is necessary for maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION AND AGE]
Insulin secretion normally decreases with age, with a decline rate of about 0.7-1% per year for basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. The rate of decline is about twofold greater in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and reaches approximately 6% per year in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
In type 2 diabetes, insulin secretion is impaired, and the decline in insulin secretion is more rapid than in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Insulin sensitivity does not decrease with aging per se, and decreases in insulin sensitivity are most likely related to other factors such as changes in body composition and physical fitness.

----
[INSULIN PRODUCTION AND CONVERSION]
Proinsulin, the insulin precursor, is converted to insulin and C-peptide within the β-cell secretory granule through a process that requires the sequential action of three peptidase enzymes. Normally, a small amount of intact proinsulin and its conversion intermediates are released into the circulation along with insulin and C-peptide, constituting 10-20% of total immunoreactive insulin measured in the circulation during the basal state.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION ABNORMALITIES]
In patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), the ratio of proinsulin and its conversion intermediates to insulin in the circulation is at least twice as high as in the general population, indicating less successful proinsulin to insulin conversion within β-cell secretory granules. This abnormality is also found in individuals with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and those who are genetically predisposed to diabetes. The impaired β-cell function is characterized by reduced first and second-phase responses to intravenous glucose and reduced early insulin response to oral glucose.

----
[β-CELL DYSFUNCTION MECHANISMS]
β-Cell dysfunction in T2DM results from a combination of genetic and acquired factors, making it a polygenic disorder. Multiple genes, including those affecting β-cell apoptosis, regeneration, glucose sensing, and ion channels, contribute to the development of diabetes. Specific polymorphisms, such as the Pro12Ala variant in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and the E23K variant of the KIR6.2 gene, have been identified as risk factors for T2DM.

----
[GENETIC CAUSES OF β-CELL DYSFUNCTION]
Genetic causes of β-cell dysfunction in T2DM involve multiple genes that affect various aspects of β-cell function, including glucose sensing, glucose metabolism, and insulin secretion. The identification of specific polymorphisms, such as those in the PPARγ and KIR6.2 genes, has provided insights into the genetic basis of T2DM. These genetic factors can contribute to the development of β-cell dysfunction and ultimately lead to the onset of T2DM.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION PATTERNS IN OBESITY]
In obese patients without comorbid diabetes or IGT, the insulin secretion pattern is similar to that of non-obese subjects, and most of the abnormalities found in T2DM are not present. However, hyperinsulinemia is often observed in obese patients as a compensatory response to increased insulin resistance. This suggests that obesity itself does not necessarily lead to the same degree of β-cell dysfunction as T2DM.
----
[GENETIC FACTORS IN T2DM]
Genetic variants, such as those in the TCF7L2 gene, have been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by impairing insulin secretion. These variants can affect the expression of GLP-1, a peptide that regulates insulin secretion. Carriers of the at-risk alleles have decreased insulin secretion, which contributes to the development of T2DM. This highlights the importance of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of T2DM.
----
[ACQUIRED FACTORS IN T2DM]
Acquired and environmental factors, such as obesity, can also impair β-cell function and increase the risk of developing T2DM. These factors can affect insulin secretion and contribute to the development of insulin resistance and T2DM. Understanding these factors is crucial for the prevention and management of T2DM.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION PATTERNS]
Insulin secretion patterns can vary between normal and obese individuals, with ultradian oscillations observed in normal weight subjects. Meals can stimulate statistically significant pulses of insulin secretion, as shown in Figure 10.6. This highlights the importance of understanding insulin secretion patterns in the context of T2DM.
----
[β-CELL FUNCTION IN T2DM]
β-cell function is already reduced to 50% at the time of diagnosis of T2DM and declines further over time, despite therapy. This decline in β-cell function can be measured using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method, as shown in Figure 10.7. This highlights the importance of early intervention and aggressive management of T2DM to preserve β-cell function.
----
[DIABETES PATHOGENESIS]
The development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is influenced by multiple risk factors, including early life malnutrition and subsequent obesity. Individuals who were born thin and later became obese are at a higher risk of developing T2DM due to their failure to increase insulin release to compensate for insulin resistance. However, not all individuals with early life malnutrition will develop T2DM if they become obese, indicating that this is just one of many risk factors.

----
[GLUCOTOXICITY EFFECTS]
Prolonged and acute hyperglycemia can adversely affect β-cell function, and improving glycemic control can improve β-cell function in patients with T2DM. The mechanisms by which hyperglycemia exerts its adverse effects on β-cells are complex and involve increased production of reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, and increased β-cell apoptosis. However, glucotoxicity is considered a secondary phenomenon that can accelerate deterioration over time.

----
[LIPOTOXICITY EFFECTS]
Individuals with T2DM have increased circulating levels of free fatty acids (FFA), which can contribute to β-cell dysfunction. Obese individuals have greater plasma FFA levels due to their greater fat mass, and those with T2DM have decreased FFA clearance, leading to higher circulating FFA levels.

----
[MALNUTRITION AND DEVELOPMENT]
Malnutrition in utero and early childhood, as well as in utero exposure to hyperglycemia, is associated with an increased risk of developing T2DM later in life. Animal experiments and retrospective studies in humans have shown that malnutrition during this period may damage β-cell development or program the β-cell to limit its ability to adapt to overnutrition.

----
[DIABETES RISK FACTORS]
Family history and genetic predisposition play a significant role in the development of T2DM, with individuals with a family history of diabetes showing impaired β-cell function even with normal glucose tolerance. Additionally, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is associated with reduced β-cell function, which can be further compromised by a family history of diabetes.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION ABNORMALITIES]
Abnormalities of insulin secretion and β-cell defects are present in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The insulin responses to GLP-1 and GIP are reduced, and it is unclear whether this is a manifestation of a generalized reduction in β-cell function. Antidiabetic drugs that enhance incretin activity or level have proven to be effective in lowering glucose in T2DM.

----
[ISLET AMYLOID DEPOSITION]
Islet amyloid deposition is a characteristic feature present in over 90% of patients with T2DM. Amyloid is composed of insoluble fibrils formed from a protein called amylin or islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is co-secreted with insulin from β-cells. However, the mature form of human IAPP is unlikely to have a primary role in the pathogenesis of T2DM.

----
[CYTOKINES AND β-CELL FUNCTION]
Cytokines, especially the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), influence β-cell function and life cycle. IL-1β can enhance β-cell proliferation and decrease apoptosis at low concentrations, but impair β-cell insulin release and increase apoptosis at higher concentrations. An IL-1 receptor antagonist has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM by protecting β-cells from IL-1β adverse effects.

----
[FATTY ACID EFFECTS ON β-CELL FUNCTION]
Prolonged elevation of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) impairs β-cell function by inhibiting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, impairing insulin gene expression, and promoting β-cell apoptosis. The mechanism involves the uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), which impairs ATP generation from glucose metabolism and decreases insulin secretion.
----
[PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by inflammatory changes and immunologic abnormalities, including increased systemic cytokines and endothelial cell activation. These changes contribute to β-cell failure, although the exact mechanisms are unclear. Islet amyloid deposits, formed from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), are a common feature in patients with type 2 diabetes. These deposits are localized in the pancreas and are not part of a systemic amyloidosis disorder.

----
[ISLET CELL CHANGES IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The pancreatic islets, which comprise 3-5% of the adult normal pancreas, undergo significant changes in type 2 diabetes. β-cells, which make up 60-80% of the islet cell population, are reduced in number and have decreased secretory granules. The islet mass is also decreased, and there is an alteration in the relative proportion of the islet cell population. Additionally, variable degrees of fibrosis of islets and endocrine tissue are observed.

----
[β-CELL CHANGES IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
In type 2 diabetes, the β-cell mass is reduced by approximately 30-50% compared to individuals with normal glucose tolerance. This reduction is caused by a decrease in the number of β-cells, rather than a decrease in cell volume. The decline in β-cell mass is attributed to an increase in β-cell apoptosis, without a sufficient compensatory increase in replication or neogenesis rate. This leads to a decrease in β-cell function and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes.

----
[ISLET AMYLOID DEPOSITS]
Islet amyloid deposits, formed from IAPP, are a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes. These deposits are insoluble and can occupy a significant portion of the islet mass. While the exact role of islet amyloid deposits in β-cell dysfunction is unclear, recent evidence suggests that the formation of intracellular smaller IAPP oligomers may be cytotoxic to β-cells and contribute to increased β-cell apoptosis.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION ABNORMALITIES]
Abnormalities of insulin secretion and β-cell defects are key factors in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Impaired insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are two main components of the disease. Research has shown that the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes involves impaired insulin secretion versus impaired insulin sensitivity. 

----
[GENETIC BASIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The genetic basis of type 2 diabetes mellitus is complex and involves multiple factors, including impaired insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Studies have identified several genetic and environmental determinants of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), highlighting the importance of understanding the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in human disease.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Insulin resistance is a key component of type 2 diabetes, and research has shown that it is responsible for the development and progression of the disease. The triumvirate of β-cell, muscle, and liver plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM, with impaired early insulin secretion and reduced suppression of glucose production contributing to impaired glucose tolerance.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF β-CELL FAILURE]
β-cell failure is a critical factor in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. The importance of β-cell failure lies in its inability to compensate for insulin resistance, leading to impaired glucose tolerance and ultimately, type 2 diabetes. Research has shown that the reduced β-cell mass is usually insufficient by itself to explain the decrease in insulin secretory capacity in patients with type 2 diabetes.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION PATTERNS]
Pulsatile insulin secretion is a key aspect of normal insulin function, with at least 75% of insulin secretion arising from punctuated insulin secretory bursts. Research has shown that pulsatile insulin secretion accounts for 70% of total insulin secretion during fasting. Additionally, glucagon-like peptide 1 has been found to increase the mass of pulsatile insulin secretion, but not its frequency or orderliness.

----
[REGULATION OF INSULIN SECRETION]
The regulation of insulin secretion is complex and involves various factors, including glucose ingestion, incretin effect, and hormonal influences. For example, glucose ingestion versus infusion has been shown to amplify insulin secretory burst mass, while somatostatin has been found to inhibit insulin burst mass. Furthermore, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has been shown to inhibit burst mass of pulsatile insulin secretion at both supraphysiological and low IGF-1 infusion rates.

----
[DIABETES AND INSULIN SECRETION]
In patients with type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, glucagon-like peptide 1 has been found to increase the secretory burst mass of pulsatile insulin secretion. Additionally, research has shown that short-term hyperglycemia can affect insulin secretion in normal humans, and that arginine-stimulated insulin secretion has dose-response characteristics in humans. Understanding these patterns and regulations of insulin secretion is crucial for the management and treatment of diabetes.

----
[RESEARCH STUDIES ON DIABETES]
Several studies have investigated the pathogenesis of diabetes, including the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, which found that type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease. Other studies have examined the glycemic durability of various treatments, such as rosiglitazone, metformin, and glyburide monotherapy, and have found that they have different effects on insulin secretion and glucose control. These studies provide valuable insights into the management and treatment of diabetes.
----
[GENETIC VARIATIONS AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Genetic variations in certain genes, such as the KCNJ11 E23K variant and the ABCC8 A1369S variant, have been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Additionally, variations in the TCF7L2 gene have also been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. These genetic variations can influence the progression to diabetes and response to interventions.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION AND RESISTANCE]
Insulin secretion and resistance play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that insulin secretory dysfunction and insulin resistance are key factors in the development of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, glucose toxicity can also alter the ability of the beta-cell to sense and respond to glucose, leading to impaired insulin secretion.

----
[GLUCOSE TOXICITY AND INSULIN ACTION]
Glucose toxicity can have a negative impact on insulin action and secretion. Acute hyperglycemia can alter the ability of the normal beta-cell to sense and respond to glucose, leading to impaired insulin secretion. Additionally, insulin treatment can improve insulin action and secretion in type 2 diabetes, and these improvements can be maintained for a period of time after insulin withdrawal.

----
[EARLY LIFE FACTORS AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Early life factors, such as fetal and infant growth, can also play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis suggests that impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes may be linked to early life factors, such as poor nutrition and growth restriction.
----
[INSULIN SIGNALING PATHWAYS]
Insulin signaling pathways in human skeletal muscle are crucial for glucose metabolism. Research has shown that early insulin signaling pathways play a significant role in diabetes. Studies have investigated the effects of various factors on insulin signaling, including the role of gut hormones and incretin hormones.

----
[INCRETIN HORMONES]
Incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), have been shown to stimulate beta-cell replication and neogenesis, resulting in increased beta-cell mass and improved glucose tolerance in diabetic rats. These hormones have been found to have a reduced effect in type 2 diabetes, which may be a cause or consequence of the diabetic state.

----
[GLP-1 TREATMENT]
GLP-1 treatment has been found to delay the onset of diabetes in db/db mice. This suggests that GLP-1 may have a potential role in the prevention or treatment of type 2 diabetes. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of GLP-1 on glucose metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic agent.

----
[BETA-CELL MASS]
Targeting beta-cell mass in type 2 diabetes has been identified as a promising area of research. New drugs based on incretins have shown potential in increasing beta-cell mass and improving glucose tolerance. However, the limitations and potential side effects of these drugs need to be further investigated.

----
[INCRETIN THERAPY]
Incretin therapy has been found to be effective and safe in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of incretin therapy found that it improved glycemic control and had a low risk of adverse effects. However, more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects and potential benefits of incretin therapy.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION ABNORMALITIES]
Abnormalities of insulin secretion and β-cell defects are crucial in understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes. Research has shown that β-cells cosecrete islet amyloid polypeptide and insulin, which plays a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Islet amyloid has been identified as a critical entity in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, and its presence can lead to β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.

----
[β-CELL DEFECTS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Studies have demonstrated that β-cell mass and function are reduced in individuals with type 2 diabetes, leading to impaired insulin secretion and glucose regulation. The reduction in β-cell mass is attributed to increased apoptosis and oxidative stress-related DNA damage. Additionally, the cellular composition of the pancreas is altered in diabetic patients, with a decrease in β-cell proportion and an increase in α-cell proportion.

----
[ROLE OF ISLET AMYLOID IN DIABETES]
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is a peptide that is cosecreted with insulin by β-cells and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The deposition of IAPP in the form of amyloid fibrils can lead to β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis, contributing to the development of diabetes. Research has shown that the presence of islet amyloid is a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes and is associated with impaired insulin secretion and glucose regulation.

----
[PANCREATIC ISLET PATHOLOGY]
The pancreatic islets of individuals with type 2 diabetes exhibit functional and molecular defects, including reduced β-cell mass, increased apoptosis, and altered cellular composition. The islets also show increased expression of oxidative stress-related genes and decreased expression of genes involved in insulin secretion. These changes contribute to the impaired glucose regulation and insulin secretion observed in type 2 diabetes.

----
[β-CELL APOPTOSIS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
β-cell apoptosis is a key feature of type 2 diabetes, and research has shown that it is increased in individuals with the disease. The apoptosis of β-cells leads to a reduction in β-cell mass and function, contributing to the development of hyperglycemia and diabetes. Factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and amyloid deposition can contribute to β-cell apoptosis in type 2 diabetes.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and it is often referred to as the metabolic syndrome when it precedes T2DM. The metabolic syndrome is characterized by a combination of risk factors, including waist circumference, glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure. These features can occur in both obese and normal-weight individuals, and they are closely correlated with the amount of fat in the liver. 

----
[METABOLIC SYNDROME DIAGNOSIS]
Diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome requires measurement of various factors, including waist circumference, glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is also a defining feature of the metabolic syndrome and can predict both T2DM and cardiovascular disease independent of obesity. The amount of fat in the liver is closely correlated with all features of the metabolic syndrome, and NAFLD frequently coexists with the metabolic syndrome.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN THE LIVER]
In the liver, insulin resistance is characterized by an impaired ability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production, leading to mild hyperglycemia and stimulation of insulin secretion. Hepatic insulin resistance also leads to hypertriglyceridemia and decreased high-density lipoprotein levels. The amount of fat in the liver is directly proportional to hepatic insulin resistance, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this association are unclear.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN ADIPOSE TISSUE]
Insulin resistance in adipose tissue is characterized by inflammation, decreased production of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin, and an impaired ability of insulin to suppress lipolysis. Raised non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels are the most important source of intrahepatocellular triglyceride, and adiponectin deficiency may contribute to fat accumulation in the liver.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN SKELETAL MUSCLE]
Insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is decreased in patients with T2DM compared to those without diabetes. At the molecular level, insulin resistance in muscle is associated with defects at multiple post-receptor sites, including impairment of insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and glucose transporter 4 translocation. Raised NEFA levels also interfere with glucose utilization and uptake by muscle.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE CAUSES]
Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes can be caused by various factors, including physiologic variations, diet-induced changes, metabolite and electrolyte disturbances, and excessive secretion of counter-regulatory hormones. These factors can lead to a decrease in insulin sensitivity, making it more difficult for glucose to enter the cells. Examples of these factors include physical inactivity, increased fat mass, puberty, pregnancy, and certain medical conditions such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE EFFECTS]
Insulin resistance can impair the action of insulin on glucose metabolism in the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to worsening glucose tolerance and increased glucose concentrations. It can also affect other actions of insulin, such as its vasodilator and antiplatelet aggregation effects. Additionally, insulin resistance can become more severe in patients with type 2 diabetes due to various factors, including chronic hyperglycemia and high free fatty acid concentrations.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES PROGRESSION]
The progression of type 2 diabetes is characterized by a linear decrease in both first-phase insulin release and insulin sensitivity in individuals who progress from normal to impaired glucose tolerance. Once the plasma glucose concentration reaches the upper limit for impaired glucose tolerance, post-glucose insulin concentrations fall, and glucose rises into the diabetic range. This progression can be observed in prospective studies, highlighting the importance of early intervention and management of insulin resistance and glucose tolerance.

----
[INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
Insulin sensitivity decreases linearly as glucose tolerance worsens, and in patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin sensitivity worsens as glucose concentrations increase. This can be caused by the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on glucose uptake or by relative insulin deficiency coupled with increases in non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. Understanding the relationship between insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance is crucial for the diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIABETES PATHOGENESIS]
The pathogenesis of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, involves insulin resistance in various tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. This insulin resistance leads to hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The underlying causes of insulin resistance are discussed, focusing on acquired factors, while genetics of type 2 diabetes is covered in a separate chapter. 

----
[METABOLIC SYNDROME]
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities that confers a substantial additional cardiovascular risk, and is defined by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) as central obesity plus any two of the following: raised triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, raised blood pressure, or raised fasting plasma glucose. According to this definition, approximately 20-25% of the world's adult population has the metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease twofold and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes fivefold.

----
[NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE]
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as excess fat in the liver (>5-10% fat histologically) not brought about by excess alcohol use or other causes of steatosis. NAFLD is associated with insulin resistance and is a predictor of both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, independent of obesity. It is commonly found in individuals with metabolic syndrome who are abdominally obese.

----
[METABOLIC SYNDROME DIAGNOSIS]
The IDF definition of metabolic syndrome requires central obesity (defined as waist circumference ≥94 cm for Europid men and ≥80 cm for Europid women) plus any two of the following four factors: raised triglyceride level, reduced HDL cholesterol, raised blood pressure, or raised fasting plasma glucose. Specific treatment for these lipid abnormalities or previously diagnosed hypertension can also be used to define the metabolic syndrome.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Insulin resistance in Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) is the main reason for sustained post-meal hyperglycemia. In patients with T2DM, the ability of the liver to store glucose during a meal appears intact or is only slightly diminished. The brain utilizes similar amounts of glucose in both normal subjects and patients with T2DM. Post-prandial hyperglycemia must be caused by the incomplete suppression of endogenous glucose production.

----
[LIPOPROTEIN METABOLISM IN T2DM]
Insulin normally suppresses the production of VLDL, especially VLDL1 apoB particles from the liver. However, in patients with T2DM, insulin fails to suppress VLDL apoB production, leading to overproduction of VLDL and increased serum triglycerides. This defect in insulin suppression of VLDL production correlates with the amount of fat in the liver and contributes to the increase in serum triglycerides in patients with insulin-resistant T2DM.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HDL LEVELS]
HDL levels are reduced in insulin-resistant patients with high serum triglycerides. Under hypertriglyceridemic conditions, there is excessive exchange of cholesterol esters and triglycerides between HDL and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, leading to the removal of HDL particles from the circulation at an accelerated rate. Subnormal activity of LPL may further decrease levels of HDL cholesterol.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND LDL PARTICLES]
Elevated concentrations of VLDL particles in the serum of patients with T2DM increase the CETP-mediated exchange of cholesterol ester and triglyceride between VLDL and LDL cholesterol particles. This increases the triglyceride content of LDL particles, making them a better substrate for hepatic lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides in the LDL particles and increases their density. The resulting small dense LDL particles are highly atherogenic and provide a plausible link between insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.

----
[INSULIN ACTION ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM IN THE LIVER]
Insulin restrains endogenous glucose production in the fasting state. Isotopic measurements of glucose production under steady-state conditions show a significant relationship between endogenous glucose production and fasting plasma glucose concentration in patients with T2DM. This relationship demonstrates that insulin resistance contributes to the increase in endogenous glucose production, despite hyperglycemia and normoinsulinemia or hyperinsulinemia.
----
[HEPATIC FATTY ACID SOURCES]
The majority of hepatic fatty acids originate from adipose tissue lipolysis, with a smaller contribution from splanchnic lipolysis, which increases in individuals with visceral obesity. In the post-prandial state, the spillover pathway and uptake of chylomicron remnants also contribute to hepatic fatty acid delivery. Subcutaneous adipose tissue provides the majority of hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) delivery. This information is based on in vivo studies using stable isotope techniques.

----
[PATHOGENESIS OF HEPATIC INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Hepatic insulin resistance is characterized by impaired insulin inhibition of glucose production, leading to hyperglycemia and stimulation of insulin secretion. The fatty liver plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, as insulin normally restrains hepatic glucose production. When the liver is fatty and insulin-resistant, this action of insulin is impaired, resulting in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.

----
[ROLE OF LIVER FAT IN HYPERGLYCEMIA AND HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA]
Liver fat exceeding 5-10% due to non-alcoholic causes is defined as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In NAFLD, insulin's ability to inhibit hepatic glucose production and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol production is impaired, leading to hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. This in turn results in lowered high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND LIVER DISEASE]
Insulin resistance is closely linked to liver disease, particularly NAFLD. The relationship between liver fat and fasting serum insulin, as well as liver fat and fasting serum triglycerides, is well-established. Studies have shown that liver fat is a key factor in the development of insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia, highlighting the importance of addressing liver health in the management of diabetes and metabolic disorders.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE MECHANISM]
Insulin resistance in Type 2 Diabetes is characterized by reduced insulin activation of PI 3-kinase, AKT2, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), and FOXO phosphorylation, leading to decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis and reduced inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. This is associated with increased diacylglycerol concentrations and PKC ε activity in the liver. Insulin resistance is also linked to increased liver fat content and hepatic insulin resistance.

----
[OBESITY AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Obesity is related to insulin resistance, with impaired insulin stimulation of glucose uptake and insulin inhibition of endogenous glucose production. However, insulin sensitivity varies considerably at any given body mass index (BMI), and liver fat content and hepatic insulin resistance are related to BMI and waist circumference. Weight loss can induce rapid and substantial changes in liver fat content and hepatic insulin sensitivity.

----
[WEIGHT LOSS AND LIVER FAT CONTENT]
Weight loss has been shown to decrease liver fat content and total body fat mass, with studies demonstrating a 39% and 14% decrease in liver fat content and total body fat mass, respectively, after an 8% weight loss over 18 weeks. Additionally, a 7% weight loss decreased liver fat content by approximately 40% over 7 weeks, with a 30% decrease in liver fat observed as early as after 2 days of a low carbohydrate diet.

----
[CELLULAR MECHANISM OF HEPATIC INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Triglycerides themselves are inert and cannot explain hepatic insulin resistance, but lipid mediators such as ceramides and diacylglycerols may play a role. Ceramides, which are sphingolipids, have been shown to accumulate in the liver during saturated fatty acid-enriched diets and are upregulated in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of insulin-resistant subjects. Diacylglycerols, on the other hand, activate protein kinase C ε (PKC ε) in the liver, which binds to and inactivates the insulin receptor substrate.
----
[DIET COMPOSITION AND LIVER FAT]
The composition of diet, particularly the amount of saturated fat, has been linked to liver fat content, with high fat and low carbohydrate diets potentially increasing liver fat. A high glycemic index diet has also been associated with high liver fat, independent of other dietary factors. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 

----
[GENETIC CAUSES OF LIVER FAT AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY]
Twin studies suggest that 35-60% of the variation in liver enzyme levels is genetically determined, and a specific allele in the PNPLA3 gene has been strongly associated with increased liver fat. This genetic variation can lead to a more than twofold increase in hepatic fat content, highlighting the importance of genetic factors in liver fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity.

----
[FAT DISTRIBUTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The distribution of body fat, particularly visceral fat around the abdomen, has been linked to insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing hypertension, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Visceral fat is thought to be more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat, potentially leading to the release of excessive amounts of free fatty acids into the portal vein and contributing to liver insulin resistance.

----
[WEIGHT GAIN AND LIVER FAT]
Weight gain has been shown to increase liver fat, with a 9.5% weight gain over 4 weeks associated with a 2.5-fold increase in liver fat content, hyperinsulinemia, and increased serum alanine aminotransferase activity. This highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy weight to prevent the accumulation of liver fat and associated metabolic disorders.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN ADIPOSE TISSUE]
Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that releases hormones such as adiponectin and leptin, and in obese subjects, it becomes inflamed, characterized by macrophage infiltration and increased expression of proinflammatory molecules. This inflammation may cause insulin resistance not only in adipose tissue but also in other tissues like the liver. The inflammation in adipose tissue is reversible, and weight loss can reduce macrophage infiltration and expression of genes involved in macrophage recruitment. 

----
[RESISTANCE TO INSULIN'S ANTI-LIPOLYTIC ACTION]
Lipolysis in adipose tissue is highly sensitive to insulin, and in normal subjects, insulin suppresses glycerol production. However, in patients with type 2 diabetes, adipose tissue is affected by insulin resistance, leading to increased triglyceride breakdown and higher plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. Unrestrained lipolysis does not occur spontaneously in type 2 diabetes due to insufficient insulin deficiency. 

----
[ROLE OF NON-ESTERIFIED FATTY ACIDS (NEFA) IN INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Increased NEFA concentrations can contribute to worsening hyperglycemia by decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and depositing triglycerides in skeletal muscle. NEFA can also stimulate glucose production in the liver, particularly via gluconeogenesis. The biochemical mechanisms through which NEFA interfere with insulin action are complex and involve multiple interactions between NEFA and glucose metabolism. 

----
[ADIPONECTIN DEFICIENCY AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Adiponectin is a hormone produced in adipose tissue with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects, particularly in the liver. Serum adiponectin levels are decreased in obese subjects and those with the metabolic syndrome, and adiponectin deficiency may contribute to insulin resistance. Treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) agonists increases serum adiponectin levels and decreases liver fat content, supporting the possibility that adiponectin regulates liver fat content in humans.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Chronic hyperglycemia can induce insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle, a phenomenon known as "glucose toxicity." This insulin resistance can contribute to lower rates of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The degree of insulin resistance in patients with T2DM is directly proportional to the severity of hyperglycemia. 
----
[GLUCOSE UTILIZATION IN DIABETES]
Despite insulin resistance, glucose utilization is stimulated acutely via the mass action effects of glucose even in patients with diabetes. This effect explains why hyperglycemic patients with T2DM are able to utilize as much glucose as normal subjects at normoglycemia. Prolonged exposure to normoglycemia can completely normalize the defect in insulin-stimulated glucose transport.
----
[HEXOSAMINE PATHWAY AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The hexosamine pathway mediates glucose-induced insulin resistance in primary cultured rat adipocytes. This pathway requires glucose, insulin, and glutamine, and its activity is increased in patients with T2DM. The end-product of the pathway, UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-N-AcGln), can attach to proteins involved in glucose-responsive and insulin-dependent transcription and signaling events.
----
[CAUSES OF INSULIN RESISTANCE IN MUSCLE]
Obesity decreases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle independently of changes in physical fitness. This decrease could be partly caused by increased non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) produced by adipose tissue and fat accumulation in myocytes. Abdominal obesity is associated with more severe insulin resistance in skeletal muscle than other types of obesity.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND VASCULAR DISEASE]
Insulin resistance, especially in obese patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), is frequently associated with abnormalities that predispose to atherothrombotic vascular disease. These abnormalities include increased levels of PAI-1, defects in platelet function, and impaired fibrinolysis. This can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in patients with insulin resistance and T2DM.

----
[INSULIN EFFECTS ON URIC ACID METABOLISM]
Insulin has been shown to reduce the renal clearance of uric acid in normal subjects, and this action is preserved in insulin-resistant states such as obesity, diabetes, and essential hypertension. This provides a potential link between hyperinsulinemia, hyperuricemia, and hypertension. Insulin's effects on uric acid metabolism may contribute to the clustering of these conditions in patients with insulin resistance.

----
[INSULIN EFFECTS ON ELECTROLYTE METABOLISM]
Insulin has several effects on electrolyte metabolism, including lowering serum potassium concentrations by stimulating potassium uptake into skeletal muscle and the splanchnic bed. It also inhibits sodium, potassium, and phosphate excretion by the kidney. These effects are preserved in patients with insulin resistance and essential hypertension, as well as in those with T2DM.

----
[RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HYPERTENSION]
The relationship between insulin resistance and hypertension is complex and not fully understood. While there is evidence that insulin resistance and hypertension are linked, independently of confounding factors such as obesity, the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed, including changes in intracellular calcium levels and impaired insulin-induced vasodilatation.

----
[INSULIN EFFECTS ON VASCULAR FUNCTION]
Insulin has several effects on vascular function, including decreasing the stiffness of large arteries and causing vasodilatation of peripheral resistance vessels. These effects are blunted in obesity and T2DM, which may contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in these conditions. Patients with T2DM have stiffer arteries than age- and weight-matched healthy subjects, which may increase their risk of cardiovascular complications.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND METABOLIC SYNDROME]
Insulin resistance is a condition characterized by a cluster of abnormalities, including impaired glucose tolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension, which is now referred to as the metabolic syndrome. This syndrome is important to recognize clinically as it is associated with an increased risk of premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, the main cause of excessive mortality in those with type 2 diabetes. The metabolic syndrome is also associated with the accumulation of fat in the liver, which can occur independently of obesity.

----
[CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The causes of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome include overeating, physical inactivity, and genetic predisposition, which can lead to fat accumulation in the liver and inflammation of adipose tissue. This inflammation is characterized by increased expression of cytokines and macrophage infiltration, leading to insulin resistance and the overproduction of free fatty acids. The liver, once fatty, overproduces glucose, VLDL, and other factors that contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome.

----
[PATHOGENESIS OF INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The pathogenesis of insulin resistance involves a complex interplay of factors, including the accumulation of fat in the liver, inflammation of adipose tissue, and the overproduction of free fatty acids. Adiponectin deficiency also characterizes inflamed adipose tissue and decreases insulin sensitivity. The liver's overproduction of glucose and VLDL, as well as other factors such as plasminogen activator 1 (PAI-1) and coagulation factors, contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome.

----
[CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Insulin resistance, even in individuals without diabetes, is characterized by abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, as well as defects in insulin regulation of lipid and uric acid metabolism. Recognizing and addressing insulin resistance is important to prevent premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk of excessive mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes is associated with defects in insulin suppression of glucose production and serum free fatty acids, independent of obesity. Research studies have shown that fat accumulation in the liver is linked to these defects. Additionally, skeletal muscle glycolysis, oxidation, and storage of glucose are also impaired in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

----
[GLUCOSE METABOLISM IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 2 diabetes impairs splanchnic uptake of glucose but does not alter intestinal glucose absorption during enteral glucose feeding. This suggests a defect in hepatic glucokinase activity, which plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism. Hyperglycemia has both acute and chronic effects on glucose metabolism, highlighting the importance of tight blood glucose control.

----
[LIVER FUNCTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The liver plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance is associated with defective regulation of triglyceride metabolism in the liver. Insulin modulates hepatic synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein B, and defects in this process contribute to dyslipidemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

----
[DIET AND LIPID METABOLISM]
Dietary factors, such as glucose and insulin, affect very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride secretion by cultured rat hepatocytes. Overproduction of large VLDL particles is driven by increased liver fat content, which is a hallmark of the metabolic syndrome. Understanding the relationship between diet, lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance is essential for developing effective treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes.

[LIPOPROTEIN METABOLISM]
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism is affected by plasma triglyceride levels, which determine the structure and composition of HDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Hepatic lipase plays a role in regulating LDL levels, and defects in this process contribute to dyslipidemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The regulation of LDL particle size distribution is also important, as small, dense LDL particles are associated with increased cardiovascular risk.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND LIPID METABOLISM]
Insulin resistance is characterized by disordered lipid metabolism, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Studies have shown that increased ceramide content and adipose tissue inflammation are associated with high liver fat content, independent of obesity. Additionally, protein kinase C is increased in the liver of individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, contributing to insulin resistance.

----
[OBESITY AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Obesity is a major risk factor for insulin resistance, and studies have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between the two. Weight loss has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce liver fat content, highlighting the importance of weight management in diabetes prevention and treatment. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is also associated with obesity and insulin resistance, and weight loss can improve this condition.

----
[DIET AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY]
Dietary factors, such as carbohydrate and fat intake, can differentially alter insulin sensitivity during caloric restriction. A low-carbohydrate diet has been shown to reduce hepatic lipid content, while a fast-food-based hyper-alimentation can induce rapid and profound elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase in healthy subjects. These findings highlight the importance of dietary management in diabetes care.

----
[BODY FAT DISTRIBUTION AND DIABETES]
Body fat distribution, particularly visceral fat, is a key factor in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Studies have shown that visceral fat is associated with an increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus. Understanding the relationship between body fat distribution and diabetes is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes, where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to impaired glucose uptake and hyperglycemia. Research has shown that insulin resistance is associated with multiple sites of insulin resistance, including skeletal muscle and liver. Studies have also demonstrated that insulin resistance is linked to increased levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides in the blood and skeletal muscle.

----
[ROLE OF FREE FATTY ACIDS IN INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Free fatty acids have been shown to play a significant role in the development of insulin resistance, with elevated levels contributing to impaired glucose metabolism and insulin signaling. Studies have demonstrated that high levels of free fatty acids can reduce insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and increase glucose production in the liver. Additionally, research has found that skeletal muscle triglyceride levels are inversely related to insulin action.

----
[INSULIN SIGNALING PATHWAYS]
Insulin signaling pathways, including the PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways, are impaired in individuals with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Research has shown that insulin resistance differentially affects these pathways, leading to reduced insulin-mediated glucose uptake and metabolism. Furthermore, studies have found that insulin-induced hexokinase II expression is reduced in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

----
[INTRA-MYOCELLULAR LIPID STORAGE AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Intra-myocellular lipid storage has been linked to insulin resistance, with studies demonstrating that increased lipid storage in skeletal muscle is associated with impaired insulin action. Research has also shown that abnormal intramyocellular fat storage and reduced glycogen levels are present in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, studies have found that skeletal muscle lipid content and oxidative enzyme activity are altered in relation to muscle fiber type in type 2 diabetes and obesity.
----
[INSULIN AND VASCULAR FUNCTION]
Insulin has a physiological effect on large blood vessels, including diminishing wave reflection in the aorta. Research has also shown that insulin-induced vasodilatation is an important aspect of vascular function. However, in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, there is marked resistance to the ability of insulin to decrease arterial stiffness. This resistance can lead to impaired endothelial function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

----
[ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature of diabetes, characterized by impaired insulin-stimulated production of nitric oxide and decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Studies have shown that insulin therapy with insulin glargine can improve in vivo endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, hyperglycemia can inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, leading to impaired endothelial function.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Insulin resistance is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Research has shown that insulin resistance can lead to abnormal sympathetic overactivity, impaired autonomic control of heart rate variation, and increased arterial stiffness. These changes can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.

----
[SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE TO INSULIN]
The sympathetic response to insulin is abnormal in patients with diabetes and obesity, characterized by impaired insulin-induced sympathetic neural activation and vasodilatation in skeletal muscle. This abnormal response can contribute to the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that insulin sensitivity regulates autonomic control of heart rate variation, independent of body weight, in normal subjects.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes, and it is often associated with other conditions such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Research has shown that insulin resistance can be influenced by various factors, including sodium sensitivity, obesity, and dietary habits. Studies have also found that insulin resistance can be impaired by hyperosmolality, metabolic acidosis, and hypophosphatemia.

----
[FACTORS INFLUENCING INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Several factors can influence insulin resistance, including age, sex, and lifestyle habits. For example, puberty and pregnancy can contribute to impaired insulin action, while a diet high in saturated fats can impair insulin sensitivity. Additionally, stress, acromegaly, and certain medications can also affect insulin resistance. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective treatment and prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes.

----
[DIETARY IMPACT ON INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Dietary habits can significantly impact insulin resistance, with some studies suggesting that substituting dietary saturated fats with monounsaturated fats can improve insulin sensitivity. Other research has found that ethanol consumption can decrease glucose utilization, while a diet high in sodium can contribute to insulin resistance. A balanced diet that is low in saturated fats and high in fiber can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HYPERTENSION]
There is a significant association between insulin resistance and hypertension, with research suggesting that sodium sensitivity and insulin resistance are closely linked. Studies have found that hypertensive patients often exhibit impaired insulin-mediated glucose metabolism, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Managing insulin resistance and hypertension through lifestyle changes and medication can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN UREMIA]
Insulin resistance is a condition that can occur in individuals with uremia, a buildup of waste products in the blood due to kidney disease. Research has shown that insulin resistance in uremia is associated with impaired glucose uptake in the body. This can lead to hyperglycemia and worsen the overall health of individuals with kidney disease.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN INFECTIONS]
Insulin resistance can also occur during acute infections, with the severity and duration of resistance depending on the type and severity of the infection. Studies have shown that insulin resistance during infections can lead to impaired glucose tolerance and worsen glycemic control. This highlights the importance of closely monitoring blood glucose levels during illnesses.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by impaired insulin action, which can lead to insulin resistance. Research has shown that individuals with type 2 diabetes have impaired insulin clearance, increased liver fat, and hepatic and adipose tissue insulin resistance. These factors contribute to the development and progression of type 2 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN ENDOCRINE DISORDERS]
Insulin resistance can also occur in individuals with endocrine disorders, such as Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. Studies have shown that these conditions can lead to impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and glycemic control. Treatment of the underlying endocrine disorder can help improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HORMONAL REPLACEMENT]
Hormonal replacement therapy, such as growth hormone replacement, can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce total body fat in individuals with growth hormone deficiency. This highlights the importance of hormonal balance in maintaining normal insulin function and glucose metabolism.
----
[GENETICS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a multifactorial heterogeneous disease with a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors influencing intermediate traits such as β-cell mass and development, insulin secretion and action, and fat distribution. The disease is thought to be polygenic and probably multigenic, with only a small fraction of the genetic risk for common adult T2DM known. Common nucleotide variants within or near genes implicated in monogenic forms of diabetes may contribute to T2DM with modest risk effects. Candidate genes identified as having an association with common polygenic T2DM include the insulin promoter and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG).

----
[GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY FACTORS]
Three general approaches to identifying genetic susceptibility factors are used: the study of candidate genes, a genome-wide scan to detect chromosomal regions with linkage in nuclear families, and a genome-wide scan for association with common variants. Genome scans of diabetic families have found loci for T2DM at several sites, including chromosomes 1q, 2q, and 12q. In 2007, five large genome-wide association studies identified new potential T2DM genes, including TCF7L2 and HHEX.

----
[GENETIC VARIANTS AND RISK PREDICTION]
The inclusion of common genetic variants associated with the risk of T2DM has a small effect on the ability to predict future development of T2DM compared with clinical risk factors alone. However, a combined genotype score based on 15 risk alleles confers a 5-8 fold increased risk of developing T2DM. Identifying subgroups of individuals at higher risk is important to target these subjects with more effective preventative measures.

----
[GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous metabolic disease resulting from defects of both insulin secretion and action. The genetic architecture of T2DM involves a complex interaction of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures, with multiple genetic variants contributing to the risk of developing the disease. Understanding the genetic architecture of T2DM is important for developing effective preventative and therapeutic strategies.
----
[GENETIC APPROACHES TO STUDYING DIABETES]
The study of diabetes genetics involves several approaches, including focusing on candidate genes, performing genome-wide scans for linkage, and conducting genome-wide association (GWA) studies. These approaches aim to identify genes underlying complex traits such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GWA studies have been successful in identifying at-risk loci and susceptibility genes for T2DM.
----
[PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex disorder resulting from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors that influence intermediate traits such as β-cell mass, insulin secretion, insulin action, fat distribution, and obesity. The disease is characterized by defects in glucose homeostasis, primarily in β-cell function and also in muscle and liver. Quantitative phenotypes related to glucose homeostasis are known to be heritable.
----
[MONOGENIC FORMS OF DIABETES]
Several monogenic forms of diabetes have been identified, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD). However, diabetes in adulthood is often a polygenic disorder, with a clear familial aggregation and increased risk for people with familial diabetes. The risk for people with familial diabetes is increased by a factor of 2-6 compared to those without a family history.
----
[GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS]
The development of T2DM is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, which affect intermediate traits relevant to the diabetic phenotype. Understanding the genetic and environmental factors contributing to T2DM is crucial for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.
----
[GENETICS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The genetics of Type 2 diabetes is complex and involves multiple genes. Monogenic forms of diabetes, such as Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), provide a paradigm for understanding the genetic components of more complex forms of diabetes. MODY is characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance of young-onset diabetes and is associated with primary insulin-secretion defects. The prevalence of MODY is estimated to be less than 1-2% of patients with Type 2 diabetes.

----
[MONOGENIC FORMS OF DIABETES]
MODY is not a single entity, but involves genetic, metabolic, and clinical heterogeneity. Heterozygous mutations or chromosome rearrangements in seven genes have been identified as responsible for the disease, including genes that encode the enzyme glucokinase and transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 α. These genes play a crucial role in glucose sensing, insulin signaling, and transcriptional control. Understanding these genes can provide insights into the molecular circuitry that maintains glucose homeostasis.

----
[GENETIC STUDIES AND MODELS]
Genetic studies of MODY and other monogenic forms of diabetes can provide valuable information about the genetic risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. Animal models of Type 2 diabetes, such as the Zucker diabetic fatty rats or fat/fat mice, can also be used to study the molecular mechanisms of the disease. These models can help identify genes responsible for diabetes and improve our understanding of the genetic background of Type 2 diabetes.

----
[SUBTYPES OF MODY]
There are several subtypes of MODY, each associated with a specific gene and primary defect. For example, MODY1 is associated with the HNF4A gene and is characterized by severe diabetes and frequent complications. MODY2 is associated with the GCK gene and is characterized by early onset and mild diabetes. Understanding the different subtypes of MODY can help clinicians diagnose and manage the disease more effectively.
----
[GENETIC VARIANTS AND DIABETES RISK]
A population-based study has shown that common variants in and upstream of the HNF1A gene influence transcriptional activity and insulin secretion, and are associated with a modestly higher risk of diabetes in subsets of elderly overweight individuals. Mutations in HNF4A and IPF1 genes have also been identified in families with late-onset type 2 diabetes. These genetic variants may contribute to the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. 
----
[GENETIC HETEROGENEITY IN HNF4A VARIANTS]
Genetic variation near the P2 region of HNF4A is associated with type 2 diabetes in some populations, such as Danish and UK populations, but not in others, such as French and other Caucasian populations, arguing for genetic heterogeneity in HNF4A variants susceptibility. This suggests that the relationship between HNF4A variants and type 2 diabetes risk may vary across different populations. 
----
[TCF2 VARIANTS AND DIABETES RISK]
Recent studies have found that several common variants in the TCF2/HNF1β gene may contribute to type 2 diabetes risk, but with modest effects. Additionally, two intronic variants in the TCF2 gene have been found to confer protection against type 2 diabetes in individuals of European, African, and Asian descent. 
----
[GENETIC BASIS OF MONOGENIC DIABETES]
Genetic variation in the WFS1 gene, which encodes the wolframin protein, can result in rare forms of monogenic diabetes, such as Wolfram syndrome and MODY type 3. Other genes, including HNF4A, IPF1, and NEUROD1/β2, have also been associated with monogenic diabetes. Further research is needed to identify additional unknown genes related to the MODY phenotype. 
----
[RELATIVE PREVALENCE OF MODY SUBTYPES]
The relative prevalence of different subtypes of MODY has been shown to vary greatly across different populations, including British, French, German, and Spanish families. This suggests that the genetic basis of MODY may differ across different populations, and highlights the need for further research into the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of MODY.
----
[GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES]
An association between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and paternally transmitted class III alleles of the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region upstream of the insulin gene (INS-VNTR) has been observed in British families. This association is also linked to increased length and weight at birth, as well as protection against Type 1 diabetes. The INS-VNTR allele length has two main classes, with class III alleles having 141-209 repeats. These genetic associations provide insight into the genetic components of T2DM.

----
[INSULIN SIGNALING PATHWAYS]
Key components of the insulin signaling pathways have been tested for their role in T2DM, particularly in the context of insulin resistance. Several genes involved in these pathways are also expressed in pancreatic β-cells and may play a role in insulin secretion. Mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been found, but patients with these mutations often present with severe insulin resistance syndromes rather than common T2DM. These findings highlight the complexity of insulin signaling in T2DM.

----
[GENETIC VARIANTS AND TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK]
Missense variants in the gene encoding the first substrate for the insulin receptor kinase (IRS1) and the muscle glycogen synthase gene (GYS1) have been detected in several populations, but their association with diabetes is not consistent across all studies. These genes may act as minor susceptibility genes, modulating the phenotype in patients but not being necessary or sufficient for disease expression. Recent studies have reported a significant effect of common variants at the IRS1 locus on T2DM risk in European descent populations.

----
[FUNCTIONALLY SIGNIFICANT POLYMORPHISMS]
Functionally significant polymorphisms have been identified in other proteins involved in insulin action, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 enzyme (ENPP1). A missense variation in the ENPP1 gene, K121Q, results in a gain-of-function mutation leading to greater inhibition of the insulin receptor and clinical insulin resistance. This variant has been associated with an earlier onset of T2DM in Europeans and obese children, suggesting that it may accelerate disease onset in predisposing individuals.
----
[GENETIC RISK FACTORS FOR T2DM]
The PTPN1 gene locus has been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Caucasian populations, with multiple SNPs linked to impaired insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Mutations in transcription factors, such as HNFs, PPARG, and IPF-1, can also contribute to the genetic risk for T2DM by dysregulating glucose or lipid metabolism. Additionally, deleterious mutations in transcription factors can lead to monogenic-like forms of diabetes with late age of onset.

----
[TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AND T2DM]
The TIEG2/KLF11 gene, which encodes the Krüppel-like factor 11 (KLF11), has been implicated in the development of T2DM, with a common polymorphism (Q62R) associated with polygenic T2DM and reduced insulin levels. However, replication studies have found inconsistent results, and the role of KLF11 in T2DM remains unclear. Other transcription factors, such as IB1, have also been linked to T2DM, with mutations affecting β-cell function and increasing susceptibility to apoptosis.

----
[GENETIC VARIANTS AND β-CELL FUNCTION]
Mutations in genes such as IB1 can impair β-cell function and increase the risk of T2DM by promoting apoptosis and reducing β-cell mass. The identification of these genetic variants highlights the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the development of T2DM. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of these genetic variants in T2DM and to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

----
[OBESITY AND T2DM RISK]
High body mass index (BMI) can exacerbate the deleterious effects of certain genetic variants, such as ENPP1 K121Q, on insulin resistance and T2DM risk. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors, including obesity, is critical in determining the risk of developing T2DM, and further research is needed to understand these relationships.
----
[GENETICS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The genetics of Type 2 diabetes involves identifying polymorphic markers that show strong allele identity by descent in diabetic family members. Genome scans have been used to identify susceptibility genes for diabetes, with over 20 scans completed involving thousands of pedigrees from different populations and ethnic groups. However, the genome-scan approach has limitations, including relatively low power to detect weak linkage signals. To improve effectiveness, researchers have used large family collections, homogeneous ethnic groups, and quantitative intermediary traits.

----
[GENOME SCAN APPROACH]
The genome-scan approach has been used to identify linkage between diabetes and specific chromosomal regions. To minimize bias, stringent criteria for linkage are used, including a statistical significance level of P < 10^-5. Replication of findings by others is also crucial to validate linked loci, although genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic differences can make replication challenging. Genotyping errors can also substantially affect linkage analyses.

----
[LINKAGE STUDIES]
Several genome scans have been published since 1996, with a summary of the best Type 2 diabetes linkage replication results presented in Table 12.3. A locus for Type 2 diabetes on chromosome 2q (NIDDM1) was initially found in Mexican Americans, and an interaction between this locus and a locus on chromosome 15 further increases susceptibility to diabetes in this population. Other regions of replicated linkage between diabetes and specific chromosomal regions have also been identified.

----
[CANDIDATE GENES FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Other genes encoding key components of insulin secretion pathways have been tested as potential candidates for a role in the genetic susceptibility of Type 2 diabetes. The pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel (IKATP) has a central role in glucose-induced insulin secretion, and its subunits, including Kir6.2, have been studied as potential candidates for a role in Type 2 diabetes.
----
[GENETIC CONTRIBUTORS TO TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Research has identified several genetic contributors to type 2 diabetes, with genome-wide scans mapping loci on chromosomes 1q, 2p, and 12q, among others. These findings provide a strong basis for believing that important genetic contributors to common type 2 diabetes exist. The identification of the NIDDM1/CAPN10 gene on 2q37 has confirmed that linkage disequilibrium mapping may be a successful strategy for unraveling other polygenic diseases.

----
[LINKAGE STUDIES IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS]
Linkage studies have been conducted in various populations, including Mexican Americans, Europeans, Pima Indians, and Finnish families, and have identified several chromosomal regions linked to diabetes and related traits. These studies have found linkages on chromosomes 1q21-25, 3q27, 10q, and 12q, among others. The findings suggest that there may be multiple genetic loci contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes.

----
[GENETIC HETEROGENEITY AND REPLICATION]
There are concerns about the heterogeneity and reliability of genetic data in multifactorial diseases like type 2 diabetes, including the lack of replication. However, a new series of genome scans has shown that results obtained from type 2 diabetes families may be reproducible, despite differences in ethnicity and environmental factors. Meta-analyses have confirmed findings and improved the quality of the data.

----
[CHROMOSOMAL REGIONS LINKED TO TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Several chromosomal regions have been linked to type 2 diabetes, including 1q21-25, 2q24.1-31.1, 2q35-37.3, 3q27-29, and 6q23.1-24.1. These regions may contain potential or validated candidate genes, such as CAPN10, PKLR, and USF1, which may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and identify the specific genetic variants involved.
----
[GENETICS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The genetics of Type 2 diabetes involves multiple susceptibility genes, with linkage found on chromosomes 1q, 20, 2p, and 3q27. The 3q27 region is particularly notable, with several candidate genes, including the APM1/ACDC gene encoding adiponectin, which has been associated with insulin sensitivity and Type 2 diabetes. Adiponectin has been shown to protect against obesity and insulin resistance in mice, and its plasma levels are decreased in obese subjects with diabetes. This makes ACDC/ACRP30 an attractive candidate gene for fat-induced metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes.

----
[TCF7L2 GENE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The TCF7L2 gene has been identified as a major Type 2 diabetes gene, with common intronic variants strongly associated with Type 2 diabetes risk. This association has been replicated in multiple ethnic groups, including white Europeans, West Africans, Mexican Americans, Indian, and Japanese populations. The estimated risk of the rs7903146 T allele, the most Type 2 diabetes-associated variant, is 1.46, making TCF7L2 variants the largest risk effect of any known Type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci.

----
[CAPN10 GENE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The CAPN10 gene has also been associated with Type 2 diabetes, with genetic variation affecting the risk of Type 2 diabetes in Europeans. While the role of CAPN10 in Type 2 diabetes is still being investigated, many studies have found associations between CAPN10 polymorphisms and Type 2 diabetes. CAPN10 was the first diabetes gene to be identified through a genome-wide scan approach, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in the development of Type 2 diabetes.

----
[GENETIC VARIANTS AND TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK]
Multiple genetic variants, including common and rare variants of ACDC/ACRP30 and EIF4A2, have been associated with Type 2 diabetes. These variants contribute to the risk of Type 2 diabetes, with some variants having a larger risk effect than others. Understanding the genetic basis of Type 2 diabetes can help identify individuals at high risk and inform the development of personalized treatment and prevention strategies.
----
[GENETIC FACTORS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The transcription factor TCF7L2 plays a crucial role in insulin secretion and has been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that TCF7L2 controls the expression of genes involved in insulin granule fusion at the plasma membrane. Carrying one TCF7L2 risk allele may increase diabetes risk by 40% – 60%. 
----
[GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES]
Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have improved our understanding of the genetic background of type 2 diabetes. These studies have identified dozens of potential candidates, including variants within or near genes such as SLC30A8, HHEX, and CDKAL1, which are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 
----
[SLC30A8 GENE AND ZINC TRANSPORT]
The SLC30A8 gene encodes a zinc membrane transporter (ZnT8) that is highly expressed in pancreatic islets. Overexpression of ZnT8 has been associated with an accumulation of zinc in intracellular vesicles and stimulated insulin secretion. A non-synonymous polymorphism in the SLC30A8 gene has been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, possibly due to impaired transporter function and decreased zinc availability for insulin co-crystallization. 
----
[POPULATION-ATTRIBUTABLE RISK FRACTION]
The population-attributable risk fraction of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele varies between ethnic groups, with an estimated contribution to 10-25% of all cases of diabetes in lean individuals in European general populations. In Eastern Asians, the population-attributable risk fraction was assessed at 18.7% for other specific risk alleles.
----
[GENETICS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The genetics of Type 2 diabetes involve multiple susceptibility genes that contribute to the risk of developing the disease. These genes are associated with various mechanisms, including insulin resistance, glucose transport, and beta-cell dysfunction. Research has identified several validated genes, such as PPARG, CAPN10, and KCNJ11, which are linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES]
Several genes have been identified as susceptibility genes for Type 2 diabetes, including HNF4A, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, and CDKAL1. These genes are associated with beta-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, and other mechanisms that contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes. The effect sizes of these genes on the risk of Type 2 diabetes vary, ranging from 1.05 to 1.47.

----
[GENETIC VARIANTS AND TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK]
Genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. For example, the SNP rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene has been shown to increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes by 1.47 times. Other SNPs, such as rs13266634 in the SLC30A8 gene and rs10946398 in the CDKAL1 gene, have also been linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.

----
[GENETIC MECHANISMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The genetic mechanisms underlying Type 2 diabetes involve complex interactions between multiple genes and pathways. For example, the CDKAL1 gene has been shown to regulate insulin secretion, and variants in this gene may lead to decreased insulin secretion and an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Other genes, such as HNF4A and TCF7L2, may also play a role in regulating beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity.
----
[GENETIC COMPONENTS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The genetic components of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are complex and involve multiple genes and variants. Rare mutations in genes such as MODY can lead to significant amino acid substitutions or truncated proteins, resulting in hyperglycemia. However, the identified genetic loci only explain a small proportion of the familial clustering of T2DM, suggesting that there are many other genetic factors at play.

----
[GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES]
Genome-wide association studies (GWA) have identified several genetic variants associated with T2DM, including variants in genes such as TCF7L2, THADA, and KCNJ11. These variants are common in the population but confer a small risk of disease, suggesting that other factors, such as environmental factors, are also necessary for the development of hyperglycemia.

----
[GENETIC HETEROGENEITY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
T2DM is a heterogeneous disorder, and the genetic variants associated with it may have different effects on different people. The genetic variants identified through GWA studies are often found in non-coding regions of genes, where they may produce subtle differences in gene expression. This heterogeneity may explain why some people with multiple risk variants do not develop T2DM.

----
[EPIDEMIOLOGY OF GENETIC VARIANTS]
The frequency of genetic variants associated with T2DM can be high in the population, but the risk of disease conferred by each variant is often small. For example, the variant in the TCF7L2 gene has a frequency of 0.26, while the variant in the THADA gene has a frequency of 0.90. This suggests that many people may carry multiple risk variants without developing T2DM.

----
[CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GENETIC RESEARCH]
The discovery of genetic variants associated with T2DM has implications for our understanding of the disease and its treatment. The identification of genetic variants associated with impaired β-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and other mechanisms may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine approaches.
----
[GENETICS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The genetics of Type 2 diabetes is complex, with multiple genes involved in the development of the disease. While the exact mechanisms by which these genes influence disease are unknown, they are thought to be involved in cell-cycle control and insulin secretion. Genetic variants that modulate fasting glycemia have been identified, but their effects on the risk of Type 2 diabetes are not always clear.

----
[FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVELS]
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels are tightly regulated within a narrow physiologic range, and disruptions to normal glucose homeostasis can lead to elevated FPG levels, a hallmark of Type 2 diabetes. Elevated FPG levels, even within the normal range, are an independent risk factor for Type 2 diabetes and are associated with increased risk of mortality.

----
[GENETIC OVERLAP WITH OTHER DISEASES]
There is a genetic overlap between Type 2 diabetes and other diseases, such as prostate cancer. Common variants in the T2DM susceptibility genes TCF2 and JAZF1 also influence prostate cancer risk, with the risk allele for T2DM having a protective effect on prostate cancer susceptibility in the case of TCF2.

----
[RESEARCH APPROACHES FOR GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION SIGNALS]
Research approaches for capturing and validating genome-wide association signals involve several steps, including robust statistical support, confirmation of markers, large-scale exact replication, and combining data sets through meta-analysis. Additional steps include genetic refinement, statistical and epidemiological refinement, and functional studies to identify causative genes and sequence variants.

----
[FUNCTIONAL STUDIES AND PHENOME MAPPING]
Functional studies, such as molecular and cellular studies, are necessary to understand the effects of genetic variants on disease. Phenome and metabolome mapping can also help identify new biomarkers and drug targets, and involve the use of techniques such as eQTL mapping, in vitro assessment in cell lines, and in vitro assessment in model organisms.
----
[PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) involves the inhibitory effect of melatonin on insulin secretion, which is mediated by the melatonin receptor MT2. Melatonin, a hormone released by the pineal gland, plays a role in regulating the circadian rhythm and has been shown to inhibit insulin release from β-cells. Blocking the melatonin ligand-receptor system could be a potential therapeutic option for T2DM. This suggests a direct link between melatonin and the development of T2DM.

[GENETIC VARIATION IN FASTING GLUCOSE LEVELS]
Genetic variation contributes to approximately one-third of the variation in fasting glucose levels in the healthy non-diabetic population. Common sequence variants in genes such as GCK, GCKR, and G6PC2 have been associated with individual variation in fasting glucose levels, but have weak effects on T2DM risk. However, non-coding variants in MTNR1B have been consistently associated with increased fasting glucose levels, reduced β-cell function, and increased T2DM risk.

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is an immune-mediated disorder that leads to destruction of the islets of Langerhans, causing profound insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, on the other hand, is a complex condition caused by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors that lead to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, and glucose effectiveness. The underlying abnormalities that lead to the development of hyperglycemia differ amongst subgroups of diabetes. Conventionally, diabetes has been categorized into two subgroups that differ in the degree of insulin deficiency present.

----
[METABOLIC CHANGES IN DIABETES]
Metabolic changes observed in type 1 diabetes are secondary to insulin deficiency interacting with environmental influences such as diet and exercise. In type 2 diabetes, although the endocrine pancreas can produce insulin, secretion and circulating concentrations of insulin are inappropriate for the prevailing glucose concentrations. This is often exacerbated by poor diet, obesity, and lack of physical activity, leading to a disorder of insulin signaling rather than a deficiency of insulin.

----
[CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM]
In the fasting state, glucose appearance is determined by the rate of endogenous glucose release from the liver and to a lesser extent the kidney, collectively referred to as endogenous glucose production. Gluconeogenesis is responsible for approximately 50-60% of endogenous glucose production following an overnight fast, utilizing three-carbon precursors such as lactate, alanine, and glycerol to synthesize glucose molecules. Glucose concentrations increase when glucose appearance exceeds glucose disappearance and continues to increase until these rates are equal.

----
[GLUCOSE DISPOSAL]
Following an overnight fast, approximately 80% of glucose disposal is insulin-independent and occurs in the brain, splanchnic tissues, and erythrocytes. The majority of insulin-mediated glucose disposal occurs in muscle, where insulin levels are low, and muscle predominantly uses free fatty acids (FFA) for fuel. In the presence of low insulin concentrations, glucose taken up by tissues is predominantly oxidized or undergoes glycolysis to release alanine and lactate, which can be re-utilized by the liver for gluconeogenesis.

----
[INSULIN SENSITIVITY]
Sensitivity to insulin varies amongst tissues, and low concentrations of insulin limit lipolysis and prevent unrestrained breakdown of fat. The sensitivity of tissues to insulin is an important factor in glucose metabolism, and changes in insulin sensitivity can have significant effects on glucose disposal and metabolism. Understanding insulin sensitivity is crucial for the management and treatment of diabetes.
----
[GLUCOSE METABOLISM AFTER MEAL INGESTION]
After eating, increases in plasma glucose stimulate insulin secretion and suppress glucagon secretion, leading to enhanced hepatic glucose uptake and suppressed hepatic glucose production. The splanchnic tissues initially extract 10-25% of ingested glucose and eventually dispose of approximately 40% of ingested glucose. This process generally limits the post-prandial rise in glucose to 7-8 mmol/L. Late post-prandial hypoglycemia is avoided by a smooth increase in hepatic glucose output to rates that closely approximate glucose uptake.
----
[PATHOGENESIS OF IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE]
The transition from normal glucose metabolism to overt diabetes involves alterations in glucose disappearance or appearance, with most epidemiologic studies suggesting that insulin action is decreased in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Insulin-induced suppression of endogenous glucose production and gluconeogenesis are impaired in people with IFG, indicating hepatic insulin resistance. Approximately 20-30% of people with IFG will develop frank diabetes within 5-10 years.
----
[REGULATION OF GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS AFTER MEAL INGESTION]
The pattern of change of post-prandial plasma glucose concentrations is determined by the extent to which glucose entering the systemic circulation exceeds or is exceeded by the rate at which glucose leaves the systemic circulation. Differences in post-prandial glucose concentrations could arise from differences in rates of meal glucose appearance, suppression of endogenous glucose production, or stimulation of glucose uptake. Post-prandial hyperglycemia is primarily caused by reduced post-prandial glucose disappearance.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION AND GLUCOSE DISAPPEARANCE IN IFG]
In individuals with IFG, insulin secretion in response to higher post-prandial glucose concentrations is impaired, accompanied by defects in glucose disappearance and consequent post-prandial hyperglycemia. A further reduction in insulin secretion eventually results in overt type 2 diabetes. Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating endogenous glucose production, which is inhibited by insulin through increased hepatic glucose uptake and decreased hepatic glucose release.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN DIABETES]
Insulin resistance in people with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) can be similar to those with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), especially when glycemic control is poor. The defect in insulin action in T1DM is tissue-specific, affecting glucose uptake in skeletal muscle but not cardiac muscle. Glucose oxidation and non-oxidative storage are decreased in proportion to glucose uptake, suggesting defects in glucose transport and/or phosphorylation.

----
[INSULIN ACTION AND BINDING]
Insulin binding and action can be decreased in adipocytes but normal in fibroblasts of people with T1DM. This discrepancy may be due to the effect of abnormal metabolic milieu rather than an intrinsic defect in insulin action. Improved chronic glycemic control can lead to improved whole-body insulin action, suggesting that insulin resistance can be reversible with proper management.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY AND GLUCOSE CONTROL]
Treatment with insulin can lead to systemic hyperinsulinemia, which may impair insulin action in people without diabetes. However, in people with T1DM, the benefits of insulin therapy in lowering glucose concentrations and reversing glucose toxicity appear to outweigh any negative effects of hyperinsulinemia on insulin action.

----
[GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND INSULIN REGULATION]
Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism, including stimulating glycogen synthesis, inhibiting glycogen breakdown, and suppressing gluconeogenesis. Post-prandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia can stimulate hepatic glycogen synthesis, replenishing hepatic glycogen stores. The relative contribution of direct and indirect pathways of glycogen synthesis is determined by factors such as meal composition, insulin, and glucagon concentrations.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by insulin deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells. Fasting hyperglycemia develops when most (>80%) of β-cells are lost, but defects in insulin secretion can be evident years before the development of diabetes in asymptomatic individuals.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Insulin secretion can be altered by changes in insulin processing or intracellular signaling, and β-cell mass decreases with increasing duration of diabetes. In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), alterations in β-cell morphology occur, including extensive intra-islet deposition of amylin. Prolonged elevations in glucose concentration after carbohydrate ingestion occur due to post-prandial glucose appearance exceeding disappearance.
----
[GLUCOSE METABOLISM IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
In the absence of insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake, substantial glucose disappearance in insulin-deficient people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) occurs by glucose excretion in the urine and by glucose uptake via non-insulin-mediated pathways. Food ingestion does not result in a rise in insulin or a reciprocal decrease in glucagon concentration, leading to abnormal hepatic glucose handling and excessive amounts of glucose reaching the systemic circulation.
----
[INSULIN ADMINISTRATION AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Insulin administration can almost completely normalize post-prandial glucose metabolism in the splanchnic and extra-splanchnic tissues by increasing circulating insulin concentrations and preventing the excessive rise in counter-regulatory hormones. Insulin administration also restores post-prandial suppression of glucose production and stimulation of glucose uptake to rates similar to those observed in subjects without diabetes.
----
[CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
People with T2DM have elevated fasting glucose levels and excessive glycemic excursions following carbohydrate ingestion, with decreased and delayed insulin secretion. Defects in insulin secretion are observed early in the evolution of T2DM, and chronic hyperglycemia alone or in combination with elevated free fatty acids (FFA) impairs insulin secretion.
----
[CAUSES OF POST-PRANDIAL HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Relative insulin deficiency, glucagon excess, or both, rather than an intrinsic defect in splanchnic glucose metabolism, are the primary causes of post-prandial hyperglycemia in people with poorly controlled T1DM. This is demonstrated by the fact that initial splanchnic glucose extraction and uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose flux do not differ between individuals with T1DM and age- and weight-matched controls when glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations are matched.
----
[GLP-1 EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE LEVELS]
Supraphysiologic concentrations of GLP-1, achieved through intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection, lower both fasting and post-prandial glucose concentrations in people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) by increasing insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, and delaying gastric emptying. GLP-1 does not alter insulin action or glucose effectiveness in T2DM. This suggests that GLP-1 can be a useful therapeutic agent in managing glucose levels in T2DM patients.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN T2DM]
People with T2DM commonly exhibit defects in insulin action, characterized by impaired insulin-induced stimulation of glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissues, as well as impaired insulin-induced suppression of glucose production. The severity of insulin resistance is influenced by multiple factors, including exercise, obesity, diet, and genetic factors, and increases with the severity of diabetes. Improved glycemic control can improve insulin resistance, but it may not be completely normalized.
----
[GLUCOSE PRODUCTION AND APPEARANCE]
Glucose production and gluconeogenesis are increased in people with T2DM, leading to elevated glucose concentrations. The failure to suppress hepatic glucose production contributes to glucose appearance, while the systemic rate of appearance of ingested glucose does not differ from that observed in individuals without diabetes. As a result, glucose disappearance is commonly higher in people with diabetes than in individuals without diabetes following a meal.
----
[DEFECTS IN INSULIN SECRETION AND ACTION]
Defects in insulin secretion and action both contribute to post-prandial hyperglycemia in T2DM. A delay in the early rise in insulin concentrations causes a delay in suppression of glucose production, resulting in excessive glycemic excursion. In contrast, a decrease in insulin action results in sustained hyperglycemia but has minimal effect on peak glucose concentrations.
----
[GLUCOSE EFFECTIVENESS]
Glucose is an important regulator of its own metabolism, stimulating glucose uptake and suppressing glucose production in the presence of basal insulin concentrations. However, this ability is impaired in T2DM, resulting in a defect in "glucose effectiveness." This defect leads to impaired glucose-induced stimulation of glucose uptake and severe hyperglycemia in response to glucose infusion.
----
[GLUCAGON SECRETION AND GLUCOSE CONTROL]
Inhibition of glucagon secretion lowers both fasting glucose and post-prandial glucose concentrations. However, failure to suppress glucagon secretion appropriately has minimal effect on glucose production and glucose tolerance when insulin secretion is intact. In contrast, it causes marked hyperglycemia when insulin secretion is decreased and delayed, as is typical in T2DM.
----
[EXERCISE AND FFA RESPONSE IN DIABETES]
In individuals with Type 1 diabetes, exercise may not allow the normal increase in free fatty acids (FFA) due to the timing of insulin administration, making them dependent on the catecholamine response to exercise to mobilize FFA. This response may be impaired in individuals with long-standing diabetes. Exercise can increase FFA flux further in people with fasting hyperglycemia, leading to high rates of ketone body production. 

----
[FFA CONCENTRATIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
FFA concentrations are commonly increased in the post-absorptive and post-prandial state in people with Type 2 diabetes, likely due to impaired insulin sensitivity of hormone-sensitive lipase. Insulin normally suppresses lipolysis and promotes FFA disposal by stimulating re-esterification in adipocytes, but this process is impaired in diabetes.

----
[INSULIN EFFECT ON LIPID METABOLISM]
Insulin and glucose stimulate adipose lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and inhibit muscle LPL, partitioning triglyceride and lipoprotein-derived fatty acids away from muscle and into adipose tissue. However, in Type 2 diabetes, insulin-induced activation of adipose LPL is delayed, while skeletal muscle LPL is activated, leading to decreased muscle glucose uptake.

----
[EFFECT OF FFA ON GLUCOSE UPTAKE AND INSULIN SECRETION]
Elevated FFA concentrations decrease muscle glucose uptake by inhibiting glucose transport, glucose phosphorylation, and muscle glycogen synthase. Acute increases in FFA stimulate insulin secretion, whereas chronic elevations inhibit insulin secretion, contributing to the metabolic abnormalities associated with Type 2 diabetes.

----
[PROTEIN METABOLISM IN DIABETES]
Insulin regulates protein synthesis and breakdown, and profound changes in body composition occur after the initiation of therapy in people with Type 1 diabetes. Insulin deficiency can lead to increased urinary nitrogen excretion, a marker of protein breakdown, and insulin therapy can help restore normal protein metabolism.

----
[LIPID METABOLISM IN DIABETES]
Triglycerides are an important energy source and storage form, and are mobilized as FFA. Plasma FFA concentrations represent a balance between release and disposal, and are taken up by and re-esterified in adipose and hepatic tissues, or oxidized in muscle or the liver. Impaired insulin action and lipid metabolism contribute to the development of diabetes.
----
[GLUCAGON SECRETION IN DIABETES]
Glucagon secretion is abnormal in people with diabetes, particularly in those with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM), and is thought to be caused by intra-islet insulin deficiency. Insulin infusion inhibits glucagon secretion, while neutralization of intra-islet insulin with anti-insulin antibodies stimulates glucagon secretion. Treatment with exogenous insulin rapidly lowers glucagon concentrations in people with T1DM.

----
[GLUCAGON EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Glucagon excess exacerbates hyperglycemia by increasing hepatic glucose release and decreasing hepatic glucose uptake. In people with diabetes, the inability to increase insulin secretion to compensate for increased glucagon concentrations leads to further increases in glucose concentrations. This can create a vicious cycle of hyperglycemia and glucagon excess.

----
[CATECHOLAMINES AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Fasting epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations may be elevated in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes, leading to further deterioration in glycemic control by impairing insulin action and stimulating glucagon secretion. Catecholamines also enhance lipolysis, increasing free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations and ketone body production.

----
[CORTISOL EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Cortisol increases endogenous glucose production while decreasing tissue glucose uptake, which can adversely affect glycemic control in people with severe defects in endogenous insulin secretion, such as those with T1DM. The nocturnal rise in cortisol also increases ketone body concentrations, gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis.

----
[GROWTH HORMONE EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Growth hormone release increases in amplitude and frequency in people with poorly controlled diabetes, stimulating gluconeogenesis, proteolysis, and lipolysis while impairing insulin-induced suppression of endogenous glucose production and stimulation of glucose uptake. This can lead to further hyperglycemia and metabolic disturbances.

----
[DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS]
Insulin deficiency is a necessary condition for the development of diabetic ketoacidosis, which is more commonly encountered in patients with T1DM than in those with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Insulin deprivation leads to unrestrained lipolysis and hepatic ketogenesis, resulting in the production of ketone bodies and metabolic acidosis.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND BETA-CELL DYSFUNCTION]
Insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction are key factors in the progression to type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that beta-cell function is a major contributor to oral glucose tolerance in high-risk relatives of individuals with diabetes. Additionally, insulin secretory dysfunction and insulin resistance play a significant role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

----
[PATHOGENESIS OF PRE-DIABETES]

[OBESITY DEFINITION]
Obesity is defined as a common chronic disorder of excessive body fat, characterized by a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 30 kg/m2. The prevalence of obesity has increased considerably over the past decades, affecting 15-30% of adult populations in Western countries. Obesity is a major risk factor for various health conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular complications, and certain types of cancer.

----
[OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Overweight and/or obesity is the most important modifiable risk factor for T2DM, with an abdominal type of body fat distribution being closely associated with the condition. Both obesity and T2DM have a strong genetic background, with susceptibility genes for obesity affecting food intake pathways and risk genes for T2DM compromising β-cell function. Environmental factors, such as energy-dense diets and lack of physical activity, also contribute to the development of obesity.

----
[OBESITY COMPLICATIONS]
Obesity impairs insulin action, causing insulin resistance in muscle, adipose tissue, liver, and other organs. It is also characterized by subacute chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, mitochondrial dysfunction, and local hypoxia. These disturbances can lead to various metabolic complications, including T2DM, cardiovascular disease, and disorders of the locomotor system.

----
[WEIGHT LOSS AND TREATMENT]
Weight loss in obese individuals can lead to rapid improvement of metabolic disturbances, including chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. Caloric restriction, rather than the macronutrient composition of the diet, is the primary factor contributing to these improvements. Bariatric surgery is a powerful approach to treating morbid obesity and can lead to significant improvement or resolution of T2DM.

----
[OBESITY CLASSIFICATION]
The diagnosis and classification of obesity are typically based on BMI, which is calculated from body weight and height. A BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 is considered the central formal criterion for defining obesity, which is further subdivided into three classes depending on the severity of excessive body fat. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a classification system for body weight, with a BMI range of 25-29.9 kg/m2 representing the category of overweight or pre-obesity.
----
[OBESITY AND DIABETES RISK]
Obesity is a significant environmental factor that contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with a 5.5-fold higher risk of diabetes associated with weight gain in industrialized countries. Weight reduction, on the other hand, can reduce the risk of diabetes by about 80%. The duration of obesity also plays a crucial role in the risk of developing T2DM. 
----
[IMPACT OF OBESITY ON DIABETES PREVALENCE]
The increase in diabetes prevalence over recent decades can be largely attributed to the increase in obesity, with 81% of the increased number of diabetes cases attributed to different classes of obesity. This suggests that obesity is the main environmental driving force for the manifestation of T2DM.
----
[FAT DISTRIBUTION AND DIABETES RISK]
The risk of developing diabetes is also influenced by the fat distribution pattern, with an abdominal pattern of fat distribution being an independent risk factor for T2DM. Waist circumference is a useful measure to assess the fat distribution pattern and should be routinely assessed when estimating the risk of diabetes, even in normal-weight subjects.
----
[CLASSIFICATION OF OBESITY AND FAT DISTRIBUTION]
The World Health Organization classifies human obesity based on body mass index (BMI), with categories including underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity (grades I, II, and III). The classification of fat distribution pattern is also important, with threshold values for moderately and markedly elevated risk for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases provided in terms of waist circumference.
----
[GENETIC BASIS OF OBESITY]
Obesity has a strong genetic basis, with certain genetic mutations affecting the central control of food intake. Functional mutations in the melanocortin-4-receptor gene are considered the most frequent cause of monogenic obesity in children, with a frequency of 2-4% of all obese cases. Recent genome-wide association studies have also identified common genetic variants that predispose to obesity at the population level. These genetic factors are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, particularly the availability of energy-dense foods.

----
[GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Family, adoption, and twin studies have shown that obesity, like type 2 diabetes, has a strong genetic basis. The heritability of body mass index (BMI) is substantial, with concordance rates for overweight being twice as high for monozygotic twins as for dizygotic twins. This suggests that body fatness is under significant genetic control, with a heritability estimate of 0.77 for BMI and waist circumference.

----
[DIABETES PREVALENCE AND BMI CATEGORIES]
The prevalence of diabetes is closely linked to BMI categories, with the majority of cases contributed by obese individuals. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) samples, the contribution of different BMI categories to the overall prevalence of diabetes is significant, with obese individuals (BMI ≥30) accounting for the majority of cases. The data shows that the prevalence of diabetes increased significantly between 1976-1980 and 1999-2004, with the largest increase contributed by the obese III (BMI ≥40) category.

----
[OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK]
Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, with the risk increasing significantly with increasing BMI.

Understanding the genetic basis of obesity and its relationship to type 2 diabetes can inform the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.
----
[OBESITY EPIDEMIC]
The worldwide epidemic of obesity is primarily a consequence of substantial changes in environment and lifestyle, including abundant food and reduced physical activity. These changes have occurred within a few decades, a period too short for genetic adaptations to optimize survival. The relative contributions of environmental factors to the obesity epidemic are hard to quantify and vary between populations. As a result, obesity has become a major public health concern.

----
[ENERGY HOMEOSTASIS]
Humans have a tight control of energy homeostasis, allowing a stable body weight to be maintained through a complex regulatory system involving central pathways and peripheral components. This system includes the secretion of leptin, gut hormones, and signals from the gastrointestinal nervous system, which induce a complex central integration according to dietary intake and nutrient requirements. The system serves to defend body weight against energy deficiency and chronic overnutrition.

----
[OBESITY AND WEIGHT REGAIN]
The complex homeostatic system that controls energy balance also explains why obese individuals exhibit a strong tendency to regain weight after intentional dietary weight reduction. This tendency is due to adaptive systems that restore initial body weight under fluctuations of energy intake and expenditure. As a result, weight loss is often difficult to maintain, and obesity can be a challenging condition to manage.

----
[GENETIC COMPONENTS OF OBESITY]
The genetic components of obesity are still not fully understood, but research has identified several gene variants that contribute to the risk of obesity. Variants near the FTO and MC4R genes have been found to have the strongest effect size on body weight. However, the risk of developing obesity and related comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, depends on individual genetic predisposition and susceptibility to environmental factors.

----
[OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK]
The lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes is approximately 30% in the white North American population, and this risk is strongly influenced by individual genetic predisposition. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and understanding the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to obesity is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.
----
[OBESITY AND DIABETES LINK]
Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and the growing fast-food industry may be a contributing factor to this link. People in the USA obtain a significant portion of their daily caloric intake from restaurant meals, with many of these meals exceeding 1000 calories. This highlights the need for public health policies to limit fast-food consumption and promote healthier food selection.

----
[ENERGY DENSITY OF FOODS]
The energy density of modern foods, particularly fast foods, is a key determinant of caloric intake and may contribute to overconsumption of calories. Fast foods have a high energy density, with an average of 1100 kJ/100g, which is significantly higher than recommended healthy diets and traditional diets. This high energy density can challenge human appetite control systems and lead to weight gain and obesity.

----
[PORTION SIZE AND OBESITY]
The increasing trend of larger portion sizes over the last few decades may also be a determinant of the obesity epidemic. Studies have shown that larger portion sizes are associated with increased caloric intake and may promote weight gain and obesity. This trend is particularly notable in fast-food restaurants and at home.

----
[SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND OBESITY]
Socioeconomic status is a strong determinant of obesity and type 2 diabetes, with a gradient between education, household income, and the prevalence of obesity. Low socioeconomic status is often associated with an unfavorable lifestyle, including poor nutrition and low physical activity, which may be mediated by the low cost of energy-dense foods and the high cost of healthy diets.

----
[GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION]
The development of obesity is determined by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, including physical activity, education, and socioeconomic status. Even in societies with an abundance of affordable and palatable food, there is a high variation in body weight across populations, highlighting the importance of individual factors in determining obesity risk.
----
[DIABETES PATHOGENESIS]
Obesity is characterized by elevated insulin secretion and decreased hepatic insulin clearance, leading to an increased β-cell volume in healthy obese subjects. The failure of the feedback system between insulin release and insulin sensitivity can result in a progressive decline in β-cell function and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Long-chain fatty acids can stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, but chronic exposure to excessive fatty acids can impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and decrease insulin biosynthesis.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION MECHANISMS]
Glucose sensing of the pancreatic β-cells requires an intact oxidative mitochondrial metabolism to generate ATP, which is a prerequisite for normal insulin secretion. Fatty acids can also exert a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion via binding to the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR 40 on the β-cell membrane, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium and secretory granule exocytosis. However, chronic exposure to excessive fatty acids can lead to impaired insulin secretion and decreased insulin biosynthesis.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
T2DM is characterized by impaired insulin action or defective secretion of insulin, or both. Both defects are thought to be required for the manifestation of the disease and are present many years before the clinical onset. Obesity increases the risk of developing T2DM by affecting insulin action, particularly in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, as well as insulin secretion.

----
[LIPIDS AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The "glucose-fatty acid cycle" hypothesis explains the relationship between obesity and T2DM, where the increased supply of non-esterified fatty acids from expanded adipose tissue depots competes with glucose utilization, particularly in muscle. This leads to an inhibition of glycolytic enzymes, reduced glucose oxidation, and increased glucose concentrations. The resulting increased hepatic glucose output contributes to glucose intolerance and the development of T2DM.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE MECHANISMS]
TNF-α is a cytokine that may contribute to insulin resistance by stimulating the phosphorylation of IRS-1, which inhibits the transduction of the insulin signal to downstream elements. This mechanism can lead to impaired glucose uptake and insulin signaling in adipose tissue. Additionally, TNF-α can also suppress GLUT 4 expression, reducing glucose uptake in cells.

----
[MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that obese individuals have smaller mitochondria with reduced bioenergetic capacity, and young insulin-resistant offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes have features of impaired mitochondrial function. This suggests that defective mitochondrial function could be a prominent feature of disturbances in both insulin secretion and action.

----
[ADIPOSE TISSUE AS A SECRETORY ORGAN]
Adipose tissue is a secretory organ that produces and releases various factors that contribute to the development of insulin resistance and other health risks. These factors include tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which exerts catabolic effects in adipose tissue, inhibits glucose uptake, and suppresses GLUT 4 expression. Other secretory products of adipose tissue include leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and interleukin-6, among others.

----
[SECRETORY PRODUCTS OF ADIPOSE TISSUE]
Adipose tissue secretes a variety of factors that can contribute to insulin resistance and other health risks. These factors can be categorized into several groups, including lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, metabolism and energy homeostasis, vasculature and angiogenesis, extracellular matrix metabolism, and immune system and acute phase reactants. Examples of these factors include lipoprotein lipase, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).
----
[INFLAMMATION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Inflammation in adipose tissue is linked to insulin resistance, with certain proteins and cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, playing a role in this process.

----
[ADIPONECTIN AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY]
Adiponectin is an adipokine that has anti-inflammatory properties and is inversely associated with BMI and the development of type 2 diabetes. It has been shown to exert antidiabetic and anti-atherosclerotic effects, including stimulating fatty acid oxidation in an AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent manner. Low concentrations of adiponectin have been linked to insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

----
[CELL SIGNALING PATHWAYS]
The JNK and IKKβ-NF-κB pathways are key signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory response in adipose tissue. These pathways are stimulated by cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, as well as lipids, and can lead to insulin resistance. Genetic or chemical inhibition of these pathways has been shown to reduce inflammation and improve insulin resistance in experimental studies.

----
[OBESITY AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The inflammatory response in adipose tissue, mediated by the JNK and IKKβ-NF-κB pathways, plays a key role in this process. Mice with a loss-of-function mutation of TLR-4 were found to be protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, highlighting the importance of this pathway in the development of insulin resistance.
----
[ADIPOSE TISSUE HYPOXIA]
Adipose tissue hypoxia, characterized by a reduction in oxygen levels, plays a critical role in the development of chronic inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and impaired adipokine secretion in obesity. This condition is caused by an expansion of adipose tissue mass, leading to fat cell hypertrophy and subsequent hypoxia. The interstitial partial oxygen pressure (PO2) in adipose tissue is reduced by up to 70% in obese individuals, resulting in low oxygen levels and increased lactate production. This hypoxic state contributes to a range of metabolic complications.

----
[IMMUNE CELL ACCUMULATION]
The accumulation of immune cells, such as macrophages, in adipose tissue is a key factor in the development of inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. Chemokines like leptin, TNF-α, and MCP-1 recruit macrophages to adipose tissue, where they release factors that augment adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance. This process is more pronounced in omental than subcutaneous adipose tissue, suggesting a link between visceral fat and metabolic complications.

----
[ROLE OF BODY FAT DISTRIBUTION]
The distribution of body fat is an important factor in the development of metabolic complications in obesity. Visceral fat, in particular, is associated with increased inflammation and insulin resistance. The relative contributions of different cellular components in adipose tissue to the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors remain unknown, but it is clear that the invading macrophages play a key role in augmenting adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND INFLAMMATION]
Insulin resistance and inflammation are closely linked in obesity, with the accumulation of immune cells in adipose tissue contributing to both conditions. The secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by macrophages and other cells in adipose tissue leads to a subacute inflammatory state, which in turn impairs insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process is crucial for the development of effective treatments for obesity and related metabolic disorders.
----
[OBESITY AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Obesity, particularly with an unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity, can lead to the development of systemic insulin resistance, affecting tissues such as the liver, muscle, and brain. This insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. Weight management is considered a crucial initial treatment step, as weight loss can improve metabolic disturbances and associated risk factors.

----
[WEIGHT MANAGEMENT AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Weight loss is an effective means to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in those at increased risk and can also improve metabolic control in those with overt type 2 diabetes. Weight reduction can help achieve a primary treatment goal of metabolic control close to normal, and almost all disturbances associated with type 2 diabetes are potentially reversible with weight loss.

----
[VISCERAL ADIPOSE TISSUE AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Visceral adipose tissue, or fat around the abdominal area, is more metabolically active and pro-inflammatory than subcutaneous fat, leading to a greater accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages. This can promote insulin resistance in the liver, as visceral adipose tissue drains into the portal vein, exposing the liver to fatty acids and proteins that contribute to insulin resistance.

----
[PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Chronic overnutrition with a high-fat, high-sugar diet can lead to the accumulation of body fat, which is the primary cause of chronic inflammation and the development of systemic insulin resistance. This inflammation can affect not only adipose tissue but also the liver and other organs, contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIETARY APPROACHES FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Recent studies have shown that low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets can be effective in improving HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipid fractions in patients with diabetes. A Mediterranean-type weight loss diet has also shown small advantages in comparison to classic low-fat, low-carbohydrate diets in overweight participants with diabetes. The macronutrient composition of the diet is secondary for weight reduction, but protein intake should be limited in patients with nephropathy.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF DIETARY ASSESSMENT AND COUNSELING]
Assessing the habitual diet of patients with type 2 diabetes and focusing counseling on timely changes to their eating habits is crucial for approaching current dietary recommendations. Efforts for dietary changes should be made as simple as possible for patients, and frequent recommendations to distribute allowed calories over 5-6 meals may not be necessary or advantageous for metabolic control.

----
[VERY LOW CALORIE DIETS FOR WEIGHT LOSS]
Very low calorie diets (VLCDs) can be a valuable option for initial weight loss in patients with poor metabolic control, leading to rapid improvement in insulin resistance and glycemic control. However, this approach requires intensive medical surveillance and can only be applied for a limited period of time, with moderate long-term results and considerable weight regain.

----
[EFFECTS OF WEIGHT LOSS ON ADIPOKINES AND INFLAMMATION]
Modest to moderate weight reduction can significantly reduce the concentrations of circulating factors such as leptin, C-reactive protein, and others by 10-50%, while adiponectin levels rise in relation to weight reduction.

[PHARMACOTHERAPY AND BARIATRIC SURGERY]
Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery have been explored as potential treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Research has shown that long-term pharmacotherapy can aid in weight loss maintenance, and bariatric surgery can lead to significant improvements in weight loss and glycemic control. However, the effectiveness and safety of these treatments must be carefully considered on an individual basis.
----
[MONOGENIC DIABETES DEFINITION]
Monogenic diabetes results from single-gene mutations that cause β-cell dysfunction or insulin resistance, accounting for 1-2% of diabetes cases. This type of diabetes is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with approximately 90% of cases initially misdiagnosed. Correct genetic diagnosis is crucial to predict clinical course, explain associated features, and guide appropriate treatment. Monogenic diabetes can be inherited in a dominant or recessive fashion.

----
[MONOGENIC DIABETES SUSPICION CRITERIA]
Monogenic diabetes should be suspected in cases with atypical presentation for type 1 or 2 diabetes, autosomal dominant family history, or characteristic associated features such as deafness or fat loss. Diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life is also unlikely to be type 1 diabetes, and a genetic cause should be sought. Additionally, patients with non-obese acanthosis nigricans should be considered for a genetic cause of insulin resistance.

----
[GLUCOKINASE GENE MUTATIONS]
Mutations in the glucokinase gene result in mild fasting hyperglycemia with modest changes in glycated hemoglobin, and patients typically do not require treatment. This condition is characterized by a resetting of fasting glucose to a higher level, typically between 5.5-8.0 mmol/L. Complications are rare, and the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.

----
[TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GENE MUTATIONS]
Mutations in the transcription factor genes HNF1A and HNF4A result in dominantly inherited progressive hyperglycemia, with symptomatic diabetes typically developing in adolescence or young adulthood. Patients with these mutations are highly sensitive to sulfonylurea treatment and may not require insulin until middle or old age.

----
[MITOCHONDRIAL MUTATIONS]
Mitochondrial mutations can result in maternally inherited diabetes, often accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss and other disorders. These mutations can cause a range of clinical presentations, including diabetes and extrapancreatic features.

----
[DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT]
Correct genetic diagnosis is essential to guide appropriate treatment for monogenic diabetes. High-dose sulfonylurea treatment may be more effective than insulin in cases with specific genetic mutations, such as those affecting the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the β-cell potassium channel. Genetic counseling and diagnosis of family members are also crucial aspects of managing monogenic diabetes.
----
[MONOGENIC DIABETES TYPES]
Monogenic diabetes is a form of diabetes caused by genetic mutations, and it can be classified into several subtypes, including familial, mild fasting hyperglycemia, and familial, young-onset diabetes. These subtypes can be further divided into transient and permanent forms, with distinct clinical features and treatment approaches. For example, permanent neonatal diabetes is typically diagnosed at birth and is characterized by stable hyperglycemia, while familial, young-onset diabetes often has a progressive course with frequent complications.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes involves a combination of clinical evaluation, genetic testing, and laboratory tests, such as the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Specific genetic tests, including those for chromosome 6q24 abnormalities, KCNJ11, and ABCC8, can help identify the underlying cause of the disease. The OGTT can also help differentiate between different subtypes of monogenic diabetes, with a low increment in glucose levels between 0 and 2 hours suggestive of certain forms of the disease.

----
[TREATMENT APPROACHES]
The treatment of monogenic diabetes depends on the specific subtype and underlying genetic cause. Some forms, such as permanent neonatal diabetes, may require insulin therapy, while others, such as familial, mild fasting hyperglycemia, may be managed with oral sulfonylureas or no treatment at all. In some cases, high-dose sulfonylureas, such as glibenclamide, may be used to control blood glucose levels. The treatment approach may also need to be adjusted during pregnancy or in the presence of other clinical features.

----
[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]
Monogenic diabetes can be distinguished from other forms of diabetes, such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes, based on clinical features, genetic testing, and laboratory results. Table 15.1 provides a summary of the key features that can help differentiate between these different forms of diabetes, including the presence of insulin dependence, parent affected, typical age of onset, and presence of obesity or acanthosis nigricans.
----
[MONOGENIC CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Monogenic causes of diabetes, such as mutations in the gene encoding the glucose sensing enzyme glucokinase (GCK) and mutations in several transcription factors, can affect β-cell development and function. The clinical presentation of these conditions varies greatly depending on the underlying genetic mutation. It is essential to define the underlying genetic etiology to provide appropriate treatment and care. 

----
[GLUCOKINASE MODY]
Glucokinase MODY is a subtype of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the GCK gene. This mutation results in a shift of the dose-response curve to the right, leading to a higher setpoint for glucose regulation. Glucokinase acts as a glucose sensor in β-cells, ensuring insulin release is appropriate to the glucose concentration.

----
[TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR MODY]
Transcription factor MODY is another subtype of MODY, resulting from mutations in transcription factors such as HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF1B. These mutations affect β-cell development and function, leading to progressive deterioration of glycemia with age. The clinical features of transcription factor MODY differ from those of glucokinase MODY, with symptoms often appearing in adolescence or early adulthood.

----
[DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MODY]
Diagnosis of MODY should be considered in patients with diabetes diagnosed under 25 years of age, who do not fully fit the phenotypes of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and who have a strong family history of diabetes. Differentiating MODY from apparent type 1 diabetes is crucial, as patients with MODY can often be effectively treated without injected insulin. Treatment for MODY depends on the specific subtype, with glucokinase MODY rarely requiring pharmacologic treatment and transcription factor MODY often responding to sulfonylurea treatment.
----
[GLUCOKINASE MODY DIAGNOSIS]
Diagnosis of glucokinase MODY is crucial in young patients to differentiate it from Type 1 diabetes, as it may be misdiagnosed and treated with insulin. Hyperglycemia in glucokinase MODY remains mild, and β-cell antibodies are usually negative. Fasting C-peptide levels are detectable, and the post-meal rise in glucose concentration is less than in Type 1 diabetes. 
----
[GLUCOKINASE MODY MANAGEMENT]
Management of glucokinase MODY does not typically involve hypoglycemic medication outside of pregnancy, as hyperglycemia is mild and complications are rare. Treatment can often be discontinued after diagnosis, but caution is advised as it is possible for Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes to coexist with a GCK mutation. Microvascular and macrovascular complications are rare even without treatment.
----
[GLUCOKINASE MODY CHARACTERISTICS]
Glucokinase MODY is an asymptomatic condition with autosomal dominant inheritance, but there may be no known family history of diabetes. It is characterized by mild hyperglycemia, lack of obesity, and features of insulin resistance. A small increment on oral glucose tolerance testing and non-progression of the condition also suggest glucokinase MODY.
----
[GLUCOKINASE FUNCTION]
Glucokinase plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism within the β-cell, acting as the rate-determining step in glucose metabolism and ultimately leading to insulin secretion. It is involved in the regulation of glycemia, and its dysfunction can lead to hyperglycemia. Glucokinase is also involved in the stimulation of granule transport and insulin secretion in response to glucose.
----
[GENETIC CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Monogenic causes of diabetes, such as glucokinase mutations, can affect blood glucose levels and insulin production. The presence of a maternal mutation can increase the birth weight of a child, while a fetal mutation can decrease it. Understanding the genetic causes of diabetes is important for proper diagnosis and treatment. 

----
[GLUCOKINASE MUTATIONS AND PREGNANCY]
Glucokinase mutations can lead to gestational diabetes, and identifying these mutations is crucial as they have a different clinical course than other cases of gestational diabetes. The birth weight of the newborn infant depends on the mutation status of both the mother and the fetus. 

----
[TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR MUTATIONS]
Transcription factor mutations, such as those in the HNF1A and HNF4A genes, can alter insulin secretion and β-cell development, leading to diabetes. These mutations can cause autosomal dominant diabetes, presenting in adolescence or early adulthood, and can result in progressive failure of insulin secretion. 

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF MONOGENIC DIABETES]
Patients with monogenic diabetes, such as those with HNF1A and HNF4A mutations, typically have a progressive β-cell dysfunction and develop diabetes in adolescence or early adulthood. They may have different extrapancreatic features, and their clinical course can vary depending on the specific mutation. 

----
[DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MONOGENIC DIABETES]
Testing fetal genotype in utero can be risky, and treatment decisions for glucokinase gestational diabetes should be based on fetal growth rather than maternal glycemia. In some cases, insulin treatment may be necessary, but early delivery may be the most successful strategy.
----
[MONOGENIC DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Monogenic diabetes, such as HNF4A-related diabetes, can be characterized by increased insulin secretion in utero and early infancy, which evolves into reduced insulin secretion and diabetes in later life. This type of diabetes often presents with macrosmia and hypoglycemia in neonates. HNF4A mutation carriers may also have reduced levels of HDL and raised LDL, while triglyceride levels are similar to population norms.

----
[DIFFERENTIATING FROM TYPE 1 DIABETES]
HNF1A-related diabetes can be difficult to distinguish from type 1 diabetes, as patients are often diagnosed with symptomatic diabetes in adolescence or young adulthood. However, genetic testing for HNF1A mutations is recommended in young adults with apparent type 1 diabetes, a parent with diabetes, and who are antibody-negative at diagnosis. Evidence of non-insulin dependence, such as good glycemic control on low doses of insulin, can increase the likelihood of a positive result.

----
[DIFFERENTIATING FROM TYPE 2 DIABETES]
HNF1A-related diabetes can also be distinguished from type 2 diabetes by certain clinical features, including young-onset diabetes, family history of diabetes, and absence of obesity or insulin resistance. A large increment in the glucose tolerance test, presence of glycosuria with blood glucose less than 10 mmol/L, and marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas can also support a diagnosis of HNF1A instead of type 2 diabetes.

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF HNF1A-RELATED DIABETES]
HNF1A-related diabetes typically presents in young adulthood, between 10 and 30 years of age, with 63% of carriers diagnosed with diabetes by the age of 25 years and 79% by the age of 35 years. Patients show deteriorating glycemia with age and require pharmacologic treatment, with a characteristic oral glucose tolerance test result showing a large 2-hour increment (>5.0 mmol/L).
----
[MANAGEMENT OF MONOGENIC DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
To manage monogenic diabetes in pregnancy, tight glucose control is crucial to minimize macrosomia. Serial antenatal ultrasound scans are recommended to monitor for macrosomia, and early delivery may be necessary if it is marked. Early measurement of neonatal glucose and consideration of diazoxide treatment are also important if hypoglycemia persists.
----
[NEONATAL DIABETES]
Neonatal diabetes, diagnosed within the first 6 months of life, is likely to have a monogenic cause rather than type 1 diabetes. This condition is rare, affecting 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births, and often presents with ketoacidosis and absent C-peptide. Approximately half of cases remit spontaneously, while the rest are permanent.
----
[GENETIC CAUSES OF NEONATAL DIABETES]
Neonatal diabetes results from mutations in key genes involved in β-cell development or function. Several genes, including KCNJ11, ABCC8, and PAX4, have been identified as causes of neonatal diabetes. Table 15.4 summarizes the known genetic causes of neonatal diabetes, including the affected protein, chromosome, or gene, prevalence, inheritance, and additional features.
----
[MANAGEMENT OF HNF1A AND HNF4A MUTATIONS]
Patients with HNF1A and HNF4A mutations are sensitive to sulfonylurea therapy, which is recommended as first-line treatment. Glycemic control with sulfonylureas is often better than with insulin, and the fasting glucose lowering effect is greater than that seen in type 2 diabetes. However, even low doses of sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia, so the starting dose should be low.
----
[TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS IN PREGNANCY]
For patients with HNF1A and HNF4A mutations, sulfonylureas can be continued during pregnancy if glycemic control is good, but insulin therapy may be necessary if control is poor. Consideration should be given to switching to glibenclamide, which has the most evidence for safety in pregnancy. If a fetus carries an HNF4A mutation, the risk of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia is high, regardless of whether the mutation comes from the mother or father.
----
[MANAGEMENT OF KCNJ11 AND ABCC8 MUTATIONS]
Patients with KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations can often transfer from insulin to sulfonylurea therapy, with significant improvements in glycemic control. Ninety percent of those with KCNJ11 mutations are able to discontinue insulin, and HbA1c levels improve with a mean drop from 65 to 46 mmol/mol (8.1 to 6.4%) after 12 weeks. Glibenclamide is a commonly used sulfonylurea agent, and the required doses are often higher than those needed for type 2 diabetes management.
----
[NEONATAL DIABETES CAUSED BY INS MUTATIONS]
Neonatal diabetes resulting from INS mutations requires insulin treatment. Affected individuals with a heterozygous KCNJ11 mutation have a 50% chance of passing on the mutation to their offspring, while the risk of further affected children is low for unaffected parents whose child is affected by a heterozygous mutation.
----
[GENETIC ETIOLOGY OF TRANSIENT NEONATAL DIABETES]
The genetic etiology of more than 90% of transient neonatal diabetes has been established, with the majority of cases resulting from abnormalities in the 6q24 region of chromosome 6, affecting imprinted genes. Paternal uniparental disomy, paternal duplication of 6q24, or abnormal methylation of the maternal copy of the chromosome can cause overexpression of the paternal copies of certain genes.
----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF 6Q24 DIABETES]
6q24 diabetes usually presents in the first week of life with severe hyperglycemia and dehydration, but usually without ketosis. The majority of cases of transient neonatal diabetes not associated with 6q24 abnormalities are caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8.
----
[PERMANENT NEONATAL DIABETES]
Approximately half of permanent neonatal diabetes is caused by mutations in the genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8, which encode the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Activating mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 prevent closure of the potassium channel, leading to hyperpolarization of the β-cell and inability to secrete insulin.
----
[MONOGENIC CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Monogenic causes of diabetes can result in transient or permanent diabetes, with some cases presenting with extrapancreatic features. Islet cell antibodies are usually negative, and C-peptide is low or negligible. Low birth weight is common, and there may be associated macroglossia and/or umbilical hernia. Insulin treatment is required for a median of 12 weeks before the patient goes into remission.
----
[NEONATAL DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Neonatal diabetes requires insulin treatment in the neonatal period, whereas treatment requirements following relapse vary from diet to oral hypoglycemics or insulin. In some cases, diabetes may be successfully managed with sulfonylureas, particularly in cases resulting from KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations. Genetic counseling depends on the underlying genetic etiology, and genetic testing is recommended at diagnosis to influence treatment.
----
[GENETIC TESTING IN NEONATAL DIABETES]
Genetic testing is recommended at the time of diagnosis of neonatal diabetes to determine whether the diabetes will be transient or permanent. Testing for 6q24 abnormalities, KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS mutations is recommended in all diabetes diagnosed before 6 months. Identifying mutations in these genes is important as it will influence treatment, and a genetic cause can be established in approximately 7% of diabetes diagnosed between 6 months and 1 year of age.
----
[DIABETES WITH EXTRAPANCREATIC FEATURES]
Some monogenic causes of diabetes are associated with distinct features occurring outside the pancreas, such as cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis. Clinical subtypes and management of monogenic β-cell diabetes that have extrapancreatic features are summarized in Figure 15.6, and include conditions such as maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD), Wolfram syndrome, and TRMA syndrome. These conditions often require specific management and treatment approaches.
----
[MATERNALLY INHERITED DIABETES AND DEAFNESS]
Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) results from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA and causes maternally inherited diabetes with sensorineural deafness, which may be accompanied by a wide range of other features. MIDD affects up to 1% of patients with diabetes but is frequently undiagnosed, and can be tested for using the m.3243A>G mutation.
----
[MITOCHONDRIAL DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Mitochondrial diabetes, also known as MIDD, is a type of diabetes that is caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA. The majority of mutation carriers develop diabetes (over 85%) and sensorineural hearing loss (over 75%). Diabetes is progressive and usually presents with insidious onset similar to type 2 diabetes, but may present acutely with ketoacidosis in approximately 8% of cases. The mean age at diagnosis of diabetes is 37 years, but the age of diagnosis can range from early adolescence to old age.

----
[MITOCHONDRIAL DNA MUTATION]
The vast majority of mitochondrial diabetes results from the m.3243A > G point mutation in mitochondrial DNA, which affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain and may result in cellular energy deficiency. This mutation can lead to abnormal β-cell function, loss of β-cell mass, and insulin deficiency, while insulin sensitivity is usually normal. Other mitochondrial DNA mutations have been implicated, but are rare. The m.3243A > G mutation is inherited from the mother and can result in a range of clinical features, including diabetes, hearing loss, and other organ dysfunction.

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF MITOCHONDRIAL DIABETES]
The clinical features of mitochondrial diabetes can vary greatly, even within the same family, due to heteroplasmy, where offspring inherit a mix of mutant and normal mitochondria. Common clinical features include diabetes, sensorineural hearing loss, and other organ dysfunction, such as renal cysts, pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiomyopathy. The disease can also cause a range of other symptoms, including constipation, myopathy, and developmental kidney disease. The phenotype can vary widely in the same family, making diagnosis and management challenging.

----
[INHERITANCE PATTERN]
Mitochondrial diabetes is inherited from the mother, as only mitochondrial DNA is passed from mother to child. This means that all children of an affected female are likely to carry the mutation, but the phenotype can vary widely due to heteroplasmy. Children of a male patient are not at risk of inheriting the mutation, as only females can pass on mitochondrial DNA. This unique inheritance pattern is important for genetic counseling and family planning.
----
[MONOGENIC CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Monogenic causes of diabetes, such as the m.3243A > G mutation, can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including hearing loss, renal failure, and cardiac abnormalities. Patients with this mutation may also experience diabetic retinopathy, macular retinal dystrophy, and other complications. The mutation can present like type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making diagnosis challenging. 
----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF MIDD]
The clinical features of MIDD (mitochondrial diabetes) include short stature, early-onset cardiomyopathy, myopathy, early-onset stroke, and macular retinal dystrophy. The presence of deafness in the patient or clustering of diabetes and/or deafness in maternal relatives should prompt investigation for the m.3243A > G mutation. GAD antibodies are usually negative in MIDD patients.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF MIDD]
Diagnosis of MIDD can be confirmed by testing for the m.3243A > G mutation, usually in blood leukocytes. However, in rare cases, the result may be negative on blood-derived DNA testing despite the presence of the mutation in other tissues. Testing of other samples, such as urine or mouthwash, may be more appropriate than blood.
----
[MANAGEMENT OF MIDD]
Management of MIDD typically requires early insulin treatment, usually within 2 years of diagnosis. There is a theoretical basis for avoiding metformin due to the risk of lactic acidosis. Co-enzyme Q10 supplementation may be beneficial, and monitoring for cardiac manifestations should be considered from a young age. Aggressive blood pressure management and early angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment may be necessary to prevent renal complications.
----
[HNF1B AND RENAL CYSTS]
HNF1B is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in various tissues, including the pancreas and kidneys. Heterozygous deletions or mutations in HNF1B can cause developmental abnormalities, including renal cysts and diabetes. The clinical features of HNF1B-related diabetes include renal abnormalities and diabetes, with a wide variation in phenotype even with identical mutations.
----
[MONOGENIC DIABETES TYPES]
Monogenic diabetes can result from various genetic mutations, including those affecting the insulin receptor or post-receptor signaling, and can be associated with other conditions such as lipodystrophies and pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. Wolcott-Rallison syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by early-onset diabetes, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and other features. Mutations in the carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) gene have been identified as a rare cause of monogenic diabetes with pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. 
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE CAUSES]
Monogenic causes of diabetes resulting from insulin resistance include inherited lipodystrophies, mutations affecting the insulin receptor or post-receptor signaling, and other monogenic syndromes associated with insulin resistance. The presence of acanthosis in a thin patient with diabetes should prompt consideration of underlying monogenic causes of insulin resistance. Insulin receptor gene mutations can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. 
----
[HNFB MUTATIONS AND DIABETES]
HNF1B mutations can cause early-onset diabetes due to both insulin deficiency and hepatic insulin resistance, and are often associated with pancreatic hypoplasia and other clinical manifestations such as abnormal liver function tests and genital tract malformations. Approximately 50% of HNF1B mutations and deletions are spontaneous, and testing for HNF1B abnormalities should be considered in individuals with unexplained cystic renal disease or other renal developmental abnormalities. 
----
[MANAGEMENT OF MONOGENIC DIABETES]
Early insulin therapy is usually required for management of diabetes in individuals with monogenic forms of the disease. Renal management is similar to management of other chronic progressive renal diseases, and regular screening for diabetes and renal abnormalities is recommended. The sulfonylurea sensitivity seen in other transcription factor diabetes is not seen in HNF1B-related diabetes. 
----
[WOLCOTT-RALLISON SYNDROME]
Wolcott-Rallison syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by early-onset diabetes, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, acute hepatic failure, renal impairment, and developmental delay, and typically requires insulin treatment. Treatment with high-dose thiamine can improve some features of the syndrome, including diabetes.
----
[INSULIN RECEPTOR MUTATIONS]
Insulin receptor mutations can cause insulin resistance, leading to impaired glucose homeostasis, hyperinsulinemia, and diabetes. The severity of the clinical phenotype depends on the extent of impairment of signal transduction resulting from the underlying mutation. Management of insulin resistance caused by insulin receptor mutations often requires insulin therapy, as insulin sensitizers may have a limited effect.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF INSULIN RECEPTOR MUTATIONS]
Insulin therapy is often required to manage insulin resistance caused by insulin receptor mutations, and high doses of insulin (over 500 units/kg/day) may be needed. U500 insulin can help reduce the volume of insulin required, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has been used to stimulate glucose uptake and glycogen storage. However, IGF-I treatment can have side effects, which may be mitigated by combining it with its principal binding protein IGFBP-3.

----
[LIPODYSTROPHIES]
Lipodystrophies are disorders characterized by the selective loss of adipose tissue, associated with insulin resistance, diabetes, and other features such as dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Inherited lipodystrophies are rare and can be caused by mutations in genes such as LMNA and PPARG, leading to autosomal dominant disorders with distinct clinical features.

----
[FAMILIAL PARTIAL LIPODYSTROPHY]
Familial partial lipodystrophy is a rare disorder associated with the loss of peripheral subcutaneous fat, often caused by mutations in LMNA or PPARG. It can lead to a muscular appearance, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and increased cardiovascular mortality. Diagnosis may be challenging, particularly in males, but early-onset diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia in a non-obese patient with marked peripheral fat loss should raise suspicion of lipodystrophy.

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF INSULIN RECEPTOR MUTATIONS]
Individuals with severe insulin resistance due to insulin receptor mutations may exhibit common features such as hyperinsulinemia, acanthosis nigricans, ovarian hyperandrogenism, and disturbances of glucose homeostasis, including hypoglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes. Three main syndromes have been described: Type A insulin resistance syndrome, Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, and leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome), with considerable clinical overlap between them.
----
[CONGENITAL GENERALIZED LIPODYSTROPHY]
Congenital generalized lipodystrophy is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a near complete absence of subcutaneous fat from birth, giving a muscular appearance. This condition is associated with severe insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol. Hepatic steatosis occurs early and may lead to cirrhosis. 
----
[MANAGEMENT OF LIPODYSTROPHY]
Management of lipodystrophy should address insulin resistance and the main causes of morbidity and mortality, including diabetes and its complications, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and psychologic distress related to appearance. Lifestyle changes, such as an extremely low-fat diet and increased physical activity, are important, and hypertriglyceridemia may require treatment with fibrates and high doses of fish oils.
----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN LIPODYSTROPHY]
Glycemic control in lipodystrophy requires a combination of oral treatments and high-dose insulin in the majority of patients. Metformin is commonly used to improve insulin sensitivity, and thiazolidinediones may also be effective in some cases. Leptin replacement has been associated with marked improvements in glycemic control and hypertriglyceridemia in some cases.
----
[INHERITED FORMS OF LIPODYSTROPHY]
There are several inherited forms of lipodystrophy, including congenital generalized lipodystrophy types 1, 2, and 3, which result from mutations in specific genes. Other rare subtypes of lipodystrophy associated with dysmorphic features include mandibuloacral dysplasia and SHORT syndrome. These conditions often have distinct phenotypes and may require different management approaches.
----
[MONOGENIC CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Monogenic causes of diabetes refer to forms of diabetes that are caused by a single genetic mutation. These conditions can result in various forms of diabetes, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and permanent neonatal diabetes. Research has identified several genetic mutations that can lead to monogenic diabetes, including mutations in the glucokinase gene.

----
[GLUCOKINASE MUTATIONS]
Glucokinase mutations are a common cause of monogenic diabetes, particularly in MODY-2 families. These mutations can impair the function of the glucokinase enzyme, which plays a critical role in glucose sensing and insulin secretion in the pancreas. Studies have identified numerous glucokinase mutations that can lead to impaired hepatic glycogen synthesis and insulin secretory abnormalities.

----
[MONOGENIC CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Other monogenic conditions, such as Alström and Bardet-Biedl syndromes, can also be associated with insulin resistance and marked obesity. These conditions often have additional neurologic and other systemic features, and may require distinct management approaches. Understanding the genetic basis of these conditions can help guide diagnosis and treatment.
----
[MONOGENIC FORMS OF DIABETES]
MODY (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young) is a form of diabetes caused by mutations in specific genes, such as HNF1A and HNF4A. These mutations can lead to beta-cell dysfunction, insulin sensitivity, and glycosuria, which precede the development of diabetes. Research has identified various mutations associated with MODY, including those in the HNF1A and HNF4A genes, which can affect the function of pancreatic beta cells.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR MODY]
The molecular genetic diagnosis of MODY involves identifying specific gene mutations, such as those in the HNF1A and HNF4A genes. Best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of MODY have been established, which include testing for mutations in these genes. This can help differentiate MODY from other forms of diabetes, such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

----
[TREATMENT OF MODY]
Patients with MODY may respond differently to various treatments, such as sulphonylureas, which can be effective in patients with HNF1A gene mutations. A genetic diagnosis of HNF1A diabetes can alter treatment and improve glycemic control in the majority of insulin-treated patients. Additionally, some studies have shown that patients with MODY may have improved prandial glucose control with lower risk of hypoglycemia when treated with certain medications, such as nateglinide.

----
[GENETIC BASIS OF DIABETES]
Research has identified various genetic mutations associated with different forms of diabetes, including MODY and type 2 diabetes. These mutations can affect the function of pancreatic beta cells and insulin sensitivity, leading to the development of diabetes. Understanding the genetic basis of diabetes can help improve diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

----
[PREVALENCE OF AUTOANTIBODIES IN DIABETES]
Islet cell antibodies have been found in normal schoolchildren, and some studies have shown that the presence of multiple autoantibodies can predict the development of type 1 diabetes. The Washington State Diabetes Prediction Study found that successful prospective prediction of type 1 diabetes was possible through multiple defined autoantibodies.
----
[MONOGENIC CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Monogenic causes of diabetes refer to genetic mutations that can lead to the development of diabetes. Research has identified several genes, including INS, KCNJ11, and ABCC8, that are associated with monogenic forms of diabetes. Mutations in these genes can cause various forms of diabetes, including neonatal diabetes, which is a rare form of diabetes that occurs in the first few months of life.

----
[NEONATAL DIABETES]
Neonatal diabetes is a rare form of diabetes that is caused by genetic mutations. It can be either permanent or transient, and is often associated with mutations in the KCNJ11 gene. Sulfonylurea therapy has been shown to be effective in treating some forms of neonatal diabetes, and can even replace insulin therapy in some cases. Research has also identified other genes, including ABCC8, that are associated with neonatal diabetes.

----
[GENETIC MUTATIONS AND DIABETES]
Genetic mutations can play a significant role in the development of diabetes. Mutations in genes such as KCNJ11 and ABCC8 can affect the function of pancreatic beta cells, leading to impaired insulin secretion and diabetes. Some mutations, such as the R201L Kir6.2 mutation, can cause early-onset diabetes, while others, such as the V59M KCNJ11 mutation, can cause cognitive impairment and other neurological symptoms.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MONOGENIC DIABETES]
Treatment options for monogenic diabetes depend on the specific genetic mutation and the type of diabetes. Sulfonylurea therapy has been shown to be effective in treating some forms of neonatal diabetes, and can even replace insulin therapy in some cases. High-dose glibenclamide has also been used to treat early-onset diabetes caused by certain genetic mutations. In some cases, treatment with sulfonylureas can improve cognitive function and other neurological symptoms associated with monogenic diabetes.
----
[MITOCHONDRIAL DIABETES]
Mitochondrial diabetes is a form of diabetes caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which can lead to maternally inherited diabetes and deafness. Research has identified a specific mutation at base pair 3243 as a common cause of this condition. Studies have also explored the effects of coenzyme Q10 treatment on patients with this mutation. 

----
[HEPATOCYTE NUCLEAR FACTOR-1BETA MUTATIONS]
Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF1B) gene have been associated with a range of phenotypes, including renal cysts and diabetes syndrome. These mutations can cause abnormalities in nephron development and are a common cause of renal disease. HNF1B mutations can also result in neonatal diabetes mellitus and polycystic, dysplastic kidneys.

----
[GENETIC CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Genetic mutations, such as those in the HNF1B gene, can cause various forms of diabetes, including neonatal diabetes mellitus and maternally inherited diabetes. These mutations can have distinct clinical manifestations and may require different management approaches. Understanding the genetic causes of diabetes is essential for providing personalized care and treatment.

----
[RENAL PHENOTYPES AND DIABETES]
Renal phenotypes, such as renal cysts and dysplastic kidneys, can be associated with diabetes, particularly in individuals with HNF1B mutations. These conditions can have significant clinical implications and may require specialized management. Research has identified specific genetic mutations that contribute to the development of these renal phenotypes in individuals with diabetes.
----
[MONOGENIC CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Monogenic causes of diabetes refer to rare genetic disorders that can lead to the development of diabetes. These disorders can result from mutations in specific genes, such as those involved in insulin signaling or adipose tissue distribution. Examples of monogenic causes of diabetes include Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and familial partial lipodystrophy.

----
[GENETIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES]
Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme insulin resistance, which can lead to the development of diabetes. Other genetic syndromes, such as familial partial lipodystrophy, can also increase the risk of developing diabetes due to abnormal adipose tissue distribution and insulin resistance.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND DIABETES]
Insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of diabetes, and genetic disorders that affect insulin signaling can increase the risk of developing insulin resistance and diabetes. For example, mutations in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) gene have been associated with severe insulin resistance, diabetes, and hypertension.

----
[LIPODYSTROPHY AND DIABETES]
Lipodystrophy refers to a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by abnormal adipose tissue distribution. Familial partial lipodystrophy, also known as Dunnigan variety, is a type of lipodystrophy that can increase the risk of developing diabetes due to insulin resistance and metabolic complications.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MONOGENIC DIABETES]
Treatment options for monogenic diabetes depend on the underlying genetic cause and may include insulin therapy, metformin, or other medications to improve insulin sensitivity. In some cases, treatment with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) or other hormones may be necessary to manage insulin resistance and metabolic complications.
----
[LIPODYSTROPHIC INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Lipodystrophic insulin resistance is a condition characterized by extreme forms of insulin resistance, often associated with mutations in the PPAR-gamma gene. This condition can lead to a range of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Research has shown that leptin replacement therapy can be effective in treating lipodystrophic insulin resistance, improving insulin sensitivity and reducing hepatic steatosis.

----
[LEPTIN REPLACEMENT THERAPY]
Leptin replacement therapy has been shown to be effective in treating patients with generalized lipodystrophy, improving insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, and restoring menstrual function in female patients. Long-term efficacy of leptin replacement has been demonstrated in several studies, with improvements in metabolic parameters and quality of life.

----
[GENETIC MUTATIONS AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Certain genetic mutations, such as those affecting the PPAR-gamma gene, can cause lipodystrophic insulin resistance. These mutations can lead to severe insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing diabetes. Understanding the molecular genetic classification of monogenic beta-cell diabetes can have important clinical implications for diagnosis and treatment.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROMES]
Syndromes of severe insulin resistance, such as Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipoatrophy, can have significant metabolic consequences, including diabetes. Early diagnosis and treatment, including leptin replacement therapy, can improve metabolic outcomes and quality of life for patients with these conditions.
----
[DRUG-INDUCED DIABETES]
Many commonly used drugs can interfere with glucose homeostasis, provoking hyperglycemia in subjects without diabetes or worsening glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Glucocorticoids, in particular, can induce dose-dependent insensitivity to insulin in its target tissues, often requiring treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Other drugs, such as thiazide diuretics, non-selective β-adrenoceptor antagonists, and certain antipsychotics, can also impair insulin secretion or increase hepatic glucose production, leading to hyperglycemia.
----
[MECHANISMS OF DRUG-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Drugs can raise blood glucose concentrations through two broad mechanisms: by reducing insulin biosynthesis or secretion, or by reducing tissue sensitivity to insulin. Glucocorticoids, for example, act on post-insulin receptor mechanisms to induce insulin resistance, while other drugs, such as diazoxide, inhibit insulin secretion. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for managing patients with drug-induced diabetes.
----
[EXAMPLES OF DIABETOGENIC DRUGS]
Several drugs can precipitate or aggravate hyperglycemia, including streptozocin, pentamidine, and ciclosporin, which can cause β-cell toxicity, as well as β2-receptor agonists, growth hormone, protease inhibitors, and antipsychotics, which can increase hepatic glucose production, induce insulin resistance, or cause weight gain. These drugs can induce diabetes in previously normoglycemic individuals, and their diabetogenic properties are essential to consider in patients with diabetes.
----
[MANAGING DRUG-INDUCED DIABETES]
Managing patients with drug-induced diabetes requires a clear understanding of the potential hyperglycemic effects of drugs and a strategy to anticipate and avoid deterioration in glycemic control. This includes monitoring blood glucose levels, adjusting drug regimens, and using oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin to control hyperglycemia. By recognizing the diabetogenic properties of drugs, healthcare providers can improve outcomes for patients with diabetes.
----
[GLUCOCORTICOIDS AND DIABETES]
Glucocorticoids can cause dose-dependent insulin resistance, leading to hyperglycemia, especially at dosages greater than 7.5 mg/day of prednisolone. The duration of exposure to glucocorticoids does not appear to be important, and hyperglycemia is generally reversible upon withdrawing the drug. This effect is not limited to oral glucocorticoids, as topical and inhaled forms can also induce hyperglycemia, especially in children.

----
[GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Glucocorticoids can worsen hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes and cause significant increases in blood glucose concentrations in previously normoglycemic individuals when given in high doses. Impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus have been reported in 14-28% of subjects receiving long-term glucocorticoids, and these individuals are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future.

----
[MECHANISMS OF GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Glucocorticoids reduce hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin through post-receptor mechanisms, including inhibiting the expression of insulin-signaling intermediate proteins, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). This can contribute to insulin resistance, although glucose-independent stimulation of insulin secretion may partially offset these effects.

----
[PREVALENCE OF GLUCOCORTICOID USE]
The therapeutic use of glucocorticoids has escalated, with nearly 1% of the UK population using oral glucocorticoids at any time, increasing to 2.5% in subjects aged 70-79 years. Inhaled corticosteroid use is even more widespread, with more than 6% of the UK population currently using an inhaled corticosteroid.

----
[MANAGING GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Thiazide diuretics should not be used to treat hypertension and sodium and water retention caused by glucocorticoids, as they can synergize with the hyperglycemic action of glucocorticoids. Instead, alternative treatments should be considered to manage these complications in patients with diabetes or those at risk of developing hyperglycemia.
----
[DIABETES AND HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES]
Hormonal contraceptives, particularly those with high estrogen content, can cause hyperglycemia and impair glucose tolerance in women. The risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance is higher in women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy. However, most currently available combined oral contraceptives contain low estrogen dosage and have been found to have little clinical impact on carbohydrate metabolism. 

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES]
The use of hormonal contraceptives, especially those with high estrogen content, can lead to post-receptor insulin resistance, resulting in decreased insulin sensitivity. Studies have shown that women taking certain contraceptive pills experience a decrease in insulin sensitivity, and some implantable hormonal contraceptives have been linked to impaired glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance.

----
[LOW-DOSE COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES AND DIABETES]
Low-dose combined oral contraceptives are considered safe for younger women with uncomplicated, well-controlled diabetes. These contraceptives have been found to have minimal effects on glucose homeostasis, and recent studies have shown no appreciable increase in the incidence of diabetes among users of current oral contraceptives.

----
[PROGESTOGEN-ONLY CONTRACEPTIVES AND DIABETES]
Progestogen-only contraceptives, such as oral progestogen-only formulations and injectable contraceptives like Depo-Provera, can cause minor hyperglycemia in healthy subjects. However, the WHO medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use do not restrict the use of progestogen-only contraceptives in women with diabetes unless diabetes has been present for over 20 years or complications are present.

----
[DRUGS THAT EXACERBATE HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Certain drugs, including glucocorticoids, thiazide diuretics, and non-selective β-adrenoceptor antagonists, can cause or exacerbate hyperglycemia. On the other hand, drugs like calcium-channel blockers, β2-adrenoceptor agonists, and α1-adrenoceptor antagonists have been found to have minor or no effects on glucose metabolism.
----
[DIURETICS AND GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
Diuretics can impair glucose tolerance, and the mechanism is thought to involve reduced pancreatic insulin release, rather than reduced insulin sensitivity. The severity of glucose intolerance is strongly correlated with the degree of hypokalemia, and the impairment of insulin secretion is reversible on restoring normokalemia. This phenomenon affects people without diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes, but not patients with type 1 diabetes receiving exogenous insulin replacement.
----
[β-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONISTS AND DIABETES RISK]
β-Adrenoceptor antagonists can induce insulin resistance, possibly partly through weight gain, and long-term studies suggest that they may increase the risk of new-onset diabetes. The risk is greater in patients with higher baseline body mass indexes and higher baseline fasting glucose concentrations. Different β-adrenoceptor antagonists have varying diabetogenic potential, with some agents such as atenolol and metoprolol carrying a higher risk.
----
[CALCIUM-CHANNEL BLOCKERS AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Calcium-channel blockers can impair glucose metabolism, although few cases of clinically significant hyperglycemia have been reported. Verapamil, in particular, can inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin release and sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion. Hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis can occur in cases of verapamil poisoning, due to a combination of impaired insulin release and insulin resistance.
----
[HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES AND DIABETES RISK]
Hyperglycemia induced by hormonal contraceptives is usually reversible on withdrawal of the contraceptive pill. Current low-dosage contraceptive pills do not appear to predispose to the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes, although there is some evidence that high-dosage pills may carry this risk.
----
[ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND DIABETES]
Estrogen replacement therapy (HRT) in women with type 2 diabetes has been associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in observational studies. However, the relationship between HRT and diabetes risk is complex and may depend on various factors, including the type and dosage of HRT used.
----
[DIABETES INDUCED BY PENTAMIDINE]
Pentamidine, a drug used to treat Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in patients with AIDS, can cause destruction of β-cells and lead to diabetes. Initially, it may induce insulin release and transient hypoglycemia, followed by diabetes. The risk of developing glucose abnormalities is higher with intravenous administration of pentamidine, and risk factors include higher doses, higher plasma creatinine concentration, and more severe anoxia.
----
[DRUGS THAT CAN CAUSE DIABETES]
Certain drugs, such as β-cell toxins, can cause permanent diabetes. An example is streptozocin, which is used to induce experimental insulin-dependent diabetes in rodents and as chemotherapy for inoperable or metastatic insulinoma in humans. These drugs can directly damage β-cells, leading to insulin-dependent diabetes.
----
[GLUCOSE ABNORMALITIES CAUSED BY PENTAMIDINE]
In patients with AIDS treated with pentamidine for Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, nearly 40% developed significant abnormalities of glucose homeostasis, including hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia followed by diabetes, and diabetes alone. The development of these glucose abnormalities is a significant concern in patients receiving pentamidine therapy.
----
[SAFE USE OF CALCIUM-CHANNEL BLOCKERS IN DIABETES]
Calcium-channel blockers can be safely used in patients with diabetes when used appropriately. However, other drugs, such as pentamidine, can have adverse effects on glucose homeostasis, and their use should be carefully monitored in patients with diabetes.
----
[PROTEASE INHIBITOR-ASSOCIATED DIABETES]
The treatment of HIV infection with protease inhibitors has been linked to the development of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, similar to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The American Diabetes Association recommends managing these cases according to their guidelines for T2DM. Insulin resistance is thought to be the underlying cause of hyperglycemia in these patients. 

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE MECHANISM]
The exact mechanism of protease inhibitor-induced insulin resistance is not fully understood, but it is proposed that these inhibitors may bind to target proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, leading to elevated circulating fatty acids that interfere with insulin signaling. This can result in a striking syndrome of peripheral lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. 

----
[INCIDENCE OF DIABETES WITH PROTEASE INHIBITORS]
The incidence of new-onset T2DM or worsening of pre-existing diabetes has been reported in 2-6% of patients receiving protease inhibitors, with a fivefold increase in the incidence of sustained glucose intolerance. Transient elevations in glucose concentrations are common in these patients. 

----
[OTHER CAUSES OF IRREVERSIBLE DIABETES]
The rodenticide pyriminil (Vacor) has been known to cause irreversible diabetes in humans when ingested accidentally or with suicidal intent, highlighting the importance of being aware of potential environmental and toxic causes of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES INDUCED BY SOMATOSTATIN ANALOGS]
Somatostatin analogs, such as lanreotide, can impair glucose tolerance and occasionally cause diabetes, particularly in people with acromegaly. The effect of these analogs on glucose metabolism is complex, as they reduce insulin resistance but also suppress insulin secretion. The net balance between these two effects determines whether glucose metabolism is improved or worsened. This can lead to inconsistent and unpredictable effects on glucose metabolism.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF HYPOGLYCEMIA WITH OCTREOTIDE]
Octreotide has been used effectively to manage refractory hypoglycemia caused by acute sulfonylurea poisoning or quinine treatment, due to its suppressive effect on insulin release. This treatment approach can help alleviate severe hypoglycemic episodes.

----
[EFFECTS OF RECOMBINANT HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) can cause reversible mild glucose intolerance and may accelerate the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals with a genetic predisposition. However, in adults with growth hormone deficiency, hGH replacement therapy has not been shown to have significant adverse effects on glycemic control, and may even improve insulin sensitivity in the long term.

----
[DIABETES RISK WITH HGH THERAPY]
New-onset diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients with HIV wasting syndrome treated with hGH in supraphysiological doses. Additionally, high doses of hGH may lead to increased fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, although these typically remain within the reference range in subjects without diabetes.

----
[POST-TRANSPLANTATION DIABETES MELLITUS]
Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has been reported in non-diabetic adult transplant recipients taking ciclosporin (cyclosporine), likely due to reversible β-cell damage and reduced insulin secretion. Animal studies have implicated direct effects on adipocytes, including resistance to insulin's actions and impairment of differentiation from pre-adipocytes to mature fat cells.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA INDUCED BY β2-ADRENOCEPTOR AGONISTS]
β2-Adrenoceptor agonists, such as salbutamol and terbutaline, can stimulate insulin secretion but often lead to hyperglycemia due to increased hepatic glucose output. High doses of these drugs can cause hyperglycemia and even diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in pregnant women.
----
[DIABETES RISK WITH ANTIPSYCHOTICS]
The use of atypical antipsychotics may increase the risk of developing diabetes, with estimated attributable risks ranging from 0.05% for risperidone to 2.03% for clozapine. However, the absolute excess risk is likely low, and most individuals receiving antipsychotics will not develop diabetes. Baseline screening and follow-up monitoring are recommended when prescribing atypical antipsychotic medication.
----
[ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND GLUCOSE CONTROL]
Certain antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants, can worsen glycemic control and reduce insulin concentrations. However, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes by decreasing appetite and relieving depression. The effect of antidepressants on glucose control can vary depending on the specific medication and individual patient.
----
[OTHER DRUGS THAT IMPACT GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
Various medications, including asparaginase, oxymetholone, danazol, nicotinic acid, and phenytoin, can impair glucose tolerance or cause hyperglycemia. These effects are often due to insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, or stimulation of glucagon secretion. It is essential to monitor glucose control when using these medications, especially in patients with diabetes.
----
[IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTS AND DIABETES RISK]
Immunosuppressive agents, such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus, can increase the risk of developing post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM). The risk of PTDM can be as high as 28% in adults receiving tacrolimus, and newer preparations of ciclosporin may increase the incidence of diabetes due to higher cumulative exposure. Regular monitoring of glucose control is crucial in patients receiving these medications.
----
[GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT]
Management of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia depends on the severity of hyperglycemia, with a target fasting blood glucose concentration of < 8 mmol/L suitable in the short term. Therapy should be adjusted by frequent blood glucose monitoring, as simple relief of symptoms alone is inadequate. Insulin therapy may be started at 0.5 U/kg bodyweight per day, divided between morning and evening doses of short- and intermediate-acting insulin, if significant hyperglycemia develops with high-dose glucocorticoid therapy.
----
[DRUG-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Clinically relevant hyperglycemia occurs most commonly with high doses of glucocorticoids, but can also be induced by other drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, isoniazid, and certain antibiotics like gatifloxacin. The incidence of gatifloxacin-induced hyperglycemia is estimated at around 1%, and the exact underlying mechanism is unknown. Transient hyperglycemia has been described following treatment or overdose with several commonly prescribed drugs.
----
[TREATMENT OF DRUG-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Treatment of drug-induced hyperglycemia involves adjusting or substituting the offending drug, if possible. For example, if hyperglycemia occurs during thiazide treatment, the need for the drug should be reassessed, and a small dose of furosemide or bumetanide may be substituted if a diuretic is required. In some cases, insulin therapy may be necessary to achieve adequate glycemic control.
----
[STERoid-INDUCED DIABETES]
Steroid-induced diabetes may not be possible to withdraw glucocorticoid therapy, but "steroid-sparing" immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine can sometimes be introduced for certain indications. Patients with diabetes who are to begin high-dosage glucocorticoid therapy must be warned that their glycemic control will worsen, and treatment for their diabetes should be adjusted prospectively.
----
[STERoid-INDUCED DIABETES]
Steroid-induced diabetes is a condition where the use of glucocorticoids, such as prednisolone, can lead to increased blood glucose levels and insulin resistance. This can be a concern for individuals taking long-term steroid therapy, as it may increase the risk of developing diabetes. Research has shown that the diabetogenic effects of glucocorticoids are more pronounced in low-insulin responders.

----
[GLUCOCORTICOID EFFECTS ON INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Glucocorticoids have been shown to induce insulin resistance in healthy subjects, which can lead to hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Studies have demonstrated that the use of oral corticosteroids can increase the risk of diabetes, and that this risk is dose-dependent. Additionally, topical corticosteroid therapy has also been linked to the induction of glycosuria and hyperglycemia.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF STEROID-INDUCED DIABETES]
The management of steroid-induced diabetes typically involves adjusting the dose of glucocorticoids and monitoring blood glucose levels closely. In some cases, the dose of glucocorticoids may need to be increased by 50% initially, with further adjustments based on the results of blood glucose monitoring. It is essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to manage steroid-induced diabetes and prevent long-term complications.
----
[DIABETES AND HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY]
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been studied for its effects on glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. Some studies have found that HRT can improve glycemic control and blood lipoproteins, while others have reported an increased risk of diabetes incidence. The Women's Health Initiative Hormone Trial found that estrogen plus progestin therapy increased the incidence of diabetes in postmenopausal women.

----
[THIAZIDE-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Thiazide diuretics, commonly used to treat hypertension, have been associated with hyperglycemia and glycosuria in patients with diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that thiazide derivatives can impair glucose tolerance and increase the risk of diabetes, particularly with prolonged use. The mechanism is thought to involve decreased insulin release and increased glucose production in the liver.

----
[INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND MENSTRUAL CYCLE]
Insulin sensitivity has been found to vary throughout the menstrual cycle, with decreased sensitivity observed during certain phases. This fluctuation may have implications for glucose metabolism and diabetes management in women. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between insulin sensitivity and the menstrual cycle.

----
[DIURETIC-INDUCED GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE]
Diuretic therapy, particularly with thiazides, has been linked to glucose intolerance and an increased risk of diabetes. Studies have reported deterioration of glucose tolerance in hypertensive patients treated with diuretics, with effects persisting even after 14 years of follow-up. The European Working Party on Hypertension in the Elderly has also reported glucose intolerance during diuretic therapy.
----
[DIABETES AND CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS]
Calcium antagonists, such as verapamil, can affect insulin release and glucose metabolism in patients with diabetes.

These medications can increase blood glucose levels, leading to ketoacidosis, especially in patients with existing diabetes. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of medication regimens are necessary to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis.

----
[MEDICATIONS AFFECTING GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Various medications can affect glucose metabolism, including serotonergic mechanisms, which can stimulate glycogen synthesis and inactivate phosphorylase in hepatocytes. Understanding the effects of these medications on glucose metabolism is essential to managing diabetes and preventing hyperglycemia. Healthcare providers should carefully consider the potential impact of medications on glucose metabolism when prescribing treatments for patients with diabetes.
----
[ENDOCRINE DISORDERS AND DIABETES]
Endocrine disorders can cause diabetes due to an excess of hormones that counteract insulin, inhibiting its secretion and/or action. Conditions such as acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma, glucagonoma, and somatostatinoma can disturb glucose homeostasis. These disorders can lead to hyperglycemia and, in some cases, overt diabetes. Effective treatment of the underlying endocrinopathy can help normalize blood glucose levels.

----
[ACROMEGALY AND DIABETES]
Acromegaly, caused by excessive growth hormone secretion, can lead to glucose intolerance or overt diabetes in approximately 50% of patients. The condition is often characterized by bony and soft tissue overgrowth, cardiovascular and metabolic pathology, and can be caused by a pituitary adenoma or other rare conditions. Diabetes is more frequent in patients with higher growth hormone levels, and serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels can predict insulin sensitivity.

----
[OTHER ENDOCRINOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND DIABETES]
Other endocrinological conditions, such as Cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma, glucagonoma, and somatostatinoma, can also disturb glucose homeostasis and lead to hyperglycemia or diabetes. Additionally, conditions like primary aldosteronism, primary hyperparathyroidism, and polycystic ovarian syndrome can contribute to glucose intolerance or diabetes, often due to insulin resistance.

----
[GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE AND DIABETES PREVALENCE]
The prevalence of glucose intolerance and diabetes varies among endocrinological conditions, with acromegaly affecting 19-56% of patients, and Cushing syndrome affecting over 50% of cases. Other conditions, such as pheochromocytoma and glucagonoma, can also lead to hyperglycemia in approximately 50% of cases, while polycystic ovarian syndrome is associated with glucose intolerance or diabetes in about 50% of cases.
----
[ACROMEGALY AND DIABETES]
Acromegaly, a condition characterized by excessive growth hormone (GH) production, can lead to insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. GH can induce insulin resistance, and insulin resistance is a consistent feature of people with acromegaly, affecting both the liver and extrahepatic tissues. This can lead to hyperglycemia, especially if pancreatic compensation is inadequate.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF ACROMEGALY]
Diagnosis of acromegaly can be made through a series of random serum measurements of GH, which is consistently detected in patients with pituitary adenomas. Alternatively, a glucose suppression test can be used, where a failure of serum GH to suppress to below 2 mU/L within 3 hours of a 75g oral glucose load is diagnostic of acromegaly. Serum IGF-I measurement can also be used as a diagnostic test, particularly as an initial screening test.

----
[COMORBIDITY WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES]
The diagnosis of acromegaly can be challenging in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), where GH hypersecretion is observed. However, IGF-I values tend to be low in poorly controlled T1DM, indicative of GH resistance, making raised serum IGF-I values a useful diagnostic marker for acromegaly in these patients.

----
[TREATMENT AND GLUCOSE CONTROL]
Treatment of acromegaly, such as trans-sphenoidal removal of the tumor, can lead to improved glucose tolerance and normalization of blood glucose levels. In some cases, an exaggerated insulin secretory response can counterbalance insulin resistance and maintain euglycemia, but eventually, β-cell compensation may fail, leading to hyperglycemia.
----
[ACROMEGALY AND DIABETES]
Acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone (GH), can lead to impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes due to insulin resistance. The excess GH leads to increased glucose production in the liver and decreased glucose uptake in muscles, resulting in hyperglycemia. If the beta cells fail to compensate for the increased demand for insulin, diabetes develops.

----
[SYMPTOMS OF ACROMEGALY]
The clinical features of acromegaly include musculoskeletal symptoms such as protruding mandible, big tongue, and enlarged hands and feet, as well as skin symptoms like thickened, greasy skin and excessive sweating. Cardiovascular symptoms include dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and metabolic symptoms like impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes.

----
[TREATMENT OF ACROMEGALY]
Treatment of acromegaly can be surgical, medical, or radiotherapy, depending on the extent of the tumor and patient wishes. Surgical treatment, typically trans-sphenoidal surgery, can be curative for microadenomas but not for large tumors. Medical therapy using somatostatin analogs can lower GH levels and shrink tumor volume in approximately 60% of patients.

----
[MECHANISMS OF HYPERGLYCEMIA IN ACROMEGALY]
The mechanisms of hyperglycemia and diabetes in acromegaly involve the excess GH leading to increased glucose production in the liver, decreased glucose uptake in muscles, and increased lipolysis, resulting in elevated non-esterified fatty acids. If the beta cells fail to compensate for the increased demand for insulin, diabetes develops.
----
[ACROMEGALY AND DIABETES]
Acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone (GH), can lead to glucose intolerance and diabetes. Normalizing GH excess through treatment can improve glucose tolerance and decrease insulin levels. However, some treatments, such as somatostatin analogs, may worsen hyperglycemia in patients with a strong underlying tendency to type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS IN ACROMEGALY]
Diabetic complications are considered rare in acromegaly, but untreated GH excess can increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. GH has been linked to proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and patients with diabetes who are GH-deficient rarely develop retinopathy. However, patients with diabetes and acromegaly do not show an increased incidence of diabetic retinopathy.
----
[GH-IGF-I AXIS IN DIABETES]
The GH-IGF-I axis is dysregulated in type 1 diabetes, with increased GH secretion and decreased serum type 2 and type 5 somatostatin receptors. This dysregulation can lead to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Treatment with somatostatin analogs or pegvisomant can improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in patients with acromegaly and diabetes.
----
[EFFECTS OF TREATMENT ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Treatment of acromegaly with pituitary surgery, irradiation, or somatostatin analogs can improve glucose tolerance and decrease insulin levels. However, some patients may experience worsening hyperglycemia, particularly those with a strong underlying tendency to type 2 diabetes. Pegvisomant therapy has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with glucose intolerance and diabetes.
----
[INSULIN AND GROWTH HORMONE INTERACTION]
In type 1 diabetes, portal insulin deficiency leads to increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), which inhibits the bioactivity of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). This results in growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion, as IGF-1 normally decreases GH secretion through negative feedback inhibition. GH hypersecretion contributes to insulin resistance, particularly during periods of poor diabetic control.

----
[GH SECRETION AND DIABETIC CONTROL]
Growth hormone secretory pulses are larger and more frequent in type 1 diabetes, leading to elevated total 24-hour serum and urinary GH levels. High circulating GH levels are most pronounced during periods of poor diabetic control and return to normal with improved control. This phenomenon is responsible for the "dawn phenomenon" of fasting hyperglycemia, where insulin resistance manifests before breakfast.

----
[IGF-1 THERAPY IN DIABETES]
Administration of recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1) as an adjunct to insulin has been shown to reverse GH hypersecretion and improve glycemic control, while reducing insulin requirements. Co-administration of IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) with IGF-1 has similar beneficial effects on carbohydrate metabolism and avoids side effects associated with IGF-1 therapy.

----
[GH RESISTANCE IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Despite GH hypersecretion, levels of IGF-1 are inappropriately low in type 1 diabetes, indicating a state of GH resistance. Hepatic resistance to GH is attributed to decreased GH receptors and post-receptor defects, leading to decreased circulating levels of GH-binding protein (GHBP). This resistance contributes to the deterioration of glycemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes during normal puberty.
----
[CUSHING'S SYNDROME AND DIABETES]
Cushing's syndrome is a condition caused by excessive levels of glucocorticoids, which can lead to glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus. It can occur as a side effect of synthetic glucocorticoids or due to endogenous causes such as adrenal tumors or ectopic ACTH secretion. The syndrome is more common in women and can cause a range of symptoms, including central obesity, thin skin, and poor wound healing. 

----
[DIABETES AND GROWTH IN CHILDREN]
Children with new-onset diabetes may experience growth failure, particularly if glycemia is poorly controlled. However, with improved management and monitoring of diabetes, growth failure in adolescents with type 1 diabetes is now rare. Intensified insulin treatment has been shown to raise IGF-I levels and increase growth velocity in children with diabetes. 

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF CUSHING'S SYNDROME]
Cushing's syndrome is characterized by a range of clinical features, including easily bruised skin, poor wound healing, thin bones, glucose intolerance, and central obesity. Other symptoms may include susceptibility to infection, hypertension, and mood disturbances. The syndrome can also cause disturbances in menstrual cycle and symptoms that overlap with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND GROWTH HORMONE]
Insulin resistance can lead to a vicious circle of raised growth hormone (GH) and poor glycemic control. Decreased IGF-I levels can cause GH hypersecretion, which in turn exacerbates insulin resistance. This can have implications for growth and development, particularly in children with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES CAUSED BY ENDOCRINE DISORDERS]
Endocrine disorders, such as Cushing's syndrome, can cause diabetes due to excessive levels of glucocorticoids, which induce insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. This is characterized by reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and utilization by peripheral tissues, and increased hepatic glucose production. As a result, 30-60% of patients with Cushing's syndrome experience impaired glucose tolerance, while 20-50% develop overt diabetes.

----
[GLUCOCORTICOID EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, have a direct impact on glucose metabolism by stimulating gluconeogenesis and increasing the supply of glucogenic substrates. This leads to increased hepatic glucose production, which contributes to hyperglycemia. Additionally, glucocorticoids have permissive effects on gluconeogenesis induced by epinephrine, further exacerbating glucose intolerance.

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF CUSHING'S SYNDROME]
Cushing's syndrome is characterized by a range of clinical features, including truncal obesity, violaceous striae, and proximal myopathy. Patients with Cushing's syndrome are also at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to prolonged excessive levels of cortisol. Removal of the underlying cause, such as a corticotroph pituitary adenoma, can lead to improvement in glucose tolerance and other clinical features.

----
[PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IN CUSHING'S SYNDROME]
Diabetes is a common complication of Cushing's syndrome, occurring in 20-50% of patients. Impaired glucose tolerance is also observed in 30-60% of cases, highlighting the need for regular glucose monitoring and management in patients with this endocrine disorder.
----
[DIAGNOSING CUSHING SYNDROME]
Cushing syndrome can be diagnosed through various tests, including measuring midnight serum cortisol, bedtime salivary cortisol, and total excretion of cortisol in a 24-hour urine collection. These tests help identify excess glucocorticoids, which can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetes. Endocrinologists often use multiple screening tests to confirm the diagnosis. The choice of test depends on the patient's condition and medical history.

----
[MECHANISMS OF HYPERGLYCEMIA IN CUSHING SYNDROME]
Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, contribute to hyperglycemia by enhancing hepatic gluconeogenesis and increasing hepatic glycogen storage. They also increase lipolysis, proteolysis, and gluconeogenesis, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing effective treatment strategies for patients with Cushing syndrome and diabetes.

----
[TREATING CUSHING SYNDROME-RELATED DIABETES]
The treatment of hyperglycemia in Cushing syndrome depends on the underlying cause. For endogenous causes, sulfonylureas or insulin therapy may be effective. For exogenous causes, such as glucocorticoid medication, treatment can be tailored to the timing and half-life of the drug. For example, intermediate-acting insulin administered at breakfast may be suitable for patients taking prednisolone in the morning.

----
[CLINICAL CHALLENGES IN DIAGNOSING CUSHING SYNDROME]
Diagnosing Cushing syndrome can be challenging, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes, as the symptoms are often non-specific, such as tiredness and weight gain. A thorough clinical examination is essential to detect more specific signs, such as violaceous stretch marks or proximal myopathy. Occult Cushing syndrome may affect up to 2% of patients with type 2 diabetes, making it crucial to consider this condition in the diagnostic workup.
----
[CUCHING SYNDROME CHARACTERISTICS]
Cushing syndrome is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms within a few months, marked hypokalemia, and weight loss, and can also lead to skin pigmentation due to excessive melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) secretion. The syndrome can be caused by ectopic or anterior pituitary sources of excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Venous sampling of the bilateral inferior petrosal sinuses can help distinguish between these sources. 

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES FOR CUSHING SYNDROME]
Diagnostic techniques for Cushing syndrome include bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BIPSS), fine cut computerized tomography (CT), MRI, and isotope-labeled scintigraphy to detect somatostatin receptors on ectopic ACTH-secreting carcinoid tumors. BIPSS can help lateralize a corticotroph adenoma by detecting a clear gradient between the right and left sinuses. 

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR CUSHING SYNDROME]
Treatment options for Cushing syndrome aim to normalize cortisol secretion, as the syndrome carries a high morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes. Curative approaches include unilateral adrenalectomy for adrenocortical sources and excision of carcinoids for ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors. Medical therapy for corticotroph adenomas remains disappointing, but pituitary tumors can be treated with trans-sphenoidal surgery or radiotherapy. 

----
[COMPLICATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF CUSHING SYNDROME]
Complications of Cushing syndrome can be managed with suppressants of adrenocortical steroidogenesis, such as ketoconazole or metyrapone, for temporary relief in highly symptomatic patients. In extreme cases, bilateral adrenalectomy can provide rapid resolution of excessive cortisol secretion, but it carries the risk of pituitary tumor growth and Nelson syndrome.
----
[DIABETES AND CUSHING'S SYNDROME]
Cushing's syndrome can cause glucose intolerance, which may resolve with successful treatment of the syndrome. However, persisting abnormalities such as visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome are common, affecting approximately 60% of patients who fulfill criteria for remission of Cushing's syndrome. Care should be taken to avoid hypoglycemia in patients dependent on replacement doses of hydrocortisone. 
----
[HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS AND DIABETES]
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been reported to be overactive in children, adolescents, and adults with diabetes, with moderate increases in urinary free cortisol excretion, plasma cortisol, and ACTH concentrations. These abnormalities are related to the duration of diabetes and the presence of diabetic neuropathy, and serum cortisol levels fall as metabolic control improves.
----
[PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA AND DIABETES]
Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors that can cause hypertension, headaches, sweating, and tachycardia due to hypersecretion of catecholamines. While the direct relationship between pheochromocytoma and diabetes is not explicitly stated, the clinical manifestations of pheochromocytoma can have an indirect impact on glucose metabolism and diabetes management.
----
[GENETIC BASIS OF PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA]
Approximately one-fifth to one-quarter of pheochromocytoma diagnoses have a hereditary basis, with particular genetic defects associated with tumor type, such as succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) and succinate dehydrogenase subunit D (SDHD) mutations, which are more frequent in extra-adrenal tumors. Mutations in SDHB are more commonly associated with a malignant phenotype.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA]
Pheochromocytomas are diagnosed by demonstrating an excess of circulating catecholamines, which can be achieved by several 24-hour urine collections measuring catecholamines, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and their metabolites. Serum measurement of normetanephrine and metanephrine are also sensitive and specific markers of pheochromocytoma. Imaging the tumor can be performed by either MRI or CT.

----
[GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE IN PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA]
Pheochromocytoma can cause glucose intolerance, but preoperative α-adrenergic blockade often has less effect on glucose intolerance compared to its effect on hypertension. Removal of the tumor can correct the metabolic abnormalities, including glucose intolerance, and resolve hypertension if presentation, diagnosis, and treatment have occurred without undue delay.

----
[TREATMENT OF PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA]
Treatment of pheochromocytoma is surgical removal of the tumor as an adrenalectomy, which can be performed laparoscopically unless malignancy is suspected. Preoperative preparation is crucial to prevent hypertensive crisis and cardiovascular collapse, and typically involves initial α-receptor blockade followed by beta-blocker. 

----
[RESOLUTION OF DIABETES AFTER TUMOR REMOVAL]
Removal of the pheochromocytoma tumor can resolve diabetes, as seen in a case where a 75-year-old man with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and severe hypertension had both conditions resolve after laparoscopic removal of the tumor.
----
[GLUCAGONOMA AND DIABETES]
Glucagonoma is a rare tumor of the α-cell of the pancreatic islet that can cause a disturbance in glucose tolerance, leading to diabetes. The glucagonoma syndrome is characterized by weight loss, necrolytic migratory erythema, diabetes, cheilosis or stomatitis, and diarrhea. Glucagonoma should be considered in patients with diabetes and unexplained weight loss or a chronic skin rash. Early diagnosis is crucial, as some cases can remain undetected for years.
----
[ADRENAL MEDULLA FUNCTION IN DIABETES]
The function of the adrenal medulla may be impaired in patients with long-standing diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness, leading to an attenuated epinephrine response to hypoglycemia. This can delay the restoration of normal serum glucose levels. However, epinephrine responses to other stimuli can remain normal, indicating a specific failure of sympathetic activation.
----
[MECHANISMS OF HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Hyperglycemia in pheochromocytoma can occur through various mechanisms, including increased hepatic glucose output, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Catecholamine excess can also contribute to hyperglycemia by inhibiting glucose uptake in muscles and promoting glucose production in the liver. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for managing diabetes in patients with pheochromocytoma.
----
[GLUCAGONOMA SYNDROME]
The glucagonoma syndrome is characterized by a rash known as necrolytic migratory erythema, normochromic normocytic anemia, a tendency to thrombosis, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. Hyperglucagonemia may contribute to the rash, as may hypoaminoacidemia and zinc deficiency. The syndrome is often associated with diabetes, which affects approximately three-quarters of individuals with glucagonoma. The hyperglycemia is largely brought about by the effects of glucagon on stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.

----
[GLUCAGONOMA TREATMENT]
Treatment of glucagonoma typically involves surgical removal of the tumor, but 50% of tumors have metastasized to the liver by the time of diagnosis. In such cases, treatment can be completed by hepatic artery embolization and/or chemotherapy, and somatostatin analogs can also suppress glucagon secretion. Normalization of glucagon levels following removal of the tumor or the use of somatostatin analogs may help alleviate the rash, and administration of zinc, a high-protein diet, and control of diabetes with insulin may also be beneficial.

----
[SOMATOSTATINOMA]
Somatostatinomas are extremely rare tumors arising from δ-cells of the pancreatic islet or enteroendocrine cells of the duodenum and ampulla of Vater, affecting 1 in 40 million individuals. They may be sporadic or part of genetic syndromes, such as MEN1. Somatostatinomas can be incidental findings during cholecystectomy, and their diagnosis and treatment are critical to managing related conditions, including diabetes.

----
[DIABETES IN GLUCAGONOMA]
Diabetes is a common feature of glucagonoma, affecting approximately three-quarters of individuals with the condition. The hyperglycemia is often mild and may respond to oral hypoglycemic agents, but in some cases, insulin therapy may be required. The diagnosis of diabetes in glucagonoma is suggested by finding a pancreatic mass and high fasting plasma glucagon concentration in the absence of other causes of hyperglucagonemia.
----
[PRIMARY HYPERALDOSTERONISM AND DIABETES]
Primary hyperaldosteronism is a condition that can lead to glucose intolerance, with approximately 50% of patients experiencing mild glucose intolerance, although overt diabetes is unusual. The condition is characterized by hypokalemia, which impairs insulin secretion. Removal of the aldosteronoma or potassium loading can correct the defects in insulin release. Defective insulin release has been implicated, with delayed or reduced insulin responses following an oral glucose challenge.

----
[PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM AND DIABETES]
Primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes, approximately threefold higher than in the general population. Insulin resistance is common, and some cases may require insulin therapy. The condition is usually caused by a parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, leading to hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone.

----
[SOMATOSTATINOMA AND DIABETES]
Somatostatinoma is a rare tumor that can cause mild, non-ketotic hyperglycemia due to the inhibitory effects of somatostatin on insulin and glucagon secretion. The condition is characterized by a triad of diabetes, steatorrhea, and gallstones, and can be diagnosed by measuring elevated fasting levels of circulating somatostatin and imaging studies. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice and can be curative.

----
[VIPOMA AND DIABETES]
VIPoma is a rare tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria. Hyperglycemia is probably secondary to the glycogenolytic effect of VIP and/or to hypokalemia, which can impair insulin secretion and sensitivity. Diagnosis is aided by serum assay for fasting VIP levels, and debulking surgery forms the mainstay of treatment.

----
[HYPERTHYROIDISM AND DIABETES]
Hyperthyroidism can lead to thyrotoxicosis, which can disturb glucose metabolism, although the exact relationship between hyperthyroidism and diabetes is not fully understood. Autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) is associated with type 1 diabetes, but the effect of thyrotoxicosis on glucose metabolism is still being researched.
----
[DIABETES AND ENDOCRINE DISORDERS]
Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) should be screened for other autoimmune disorders, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, by measuring serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) annually. Additionally, the development of Addison disease in patients with T1DM can increase sensitivity to insulin, leading to unexpected hypoglycemic reactions. Rare conditions like autoimmune polyglandular syndromes or POEMS syndrome may also occur. These conditions can have a significant impact on diabetes management and overall health.

----
[POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) DEFINITION]
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is defined as clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism with oligo- or anovulation, where other definable causes have been excluded. PCOS is characterized by insulin resistance, although beta-cell dysfunction is also present. The diagnosis of PCOS is one of exclusion, and it is estimated to occur in 5-10% of women of reproductive age.

----
[PCOS AND DIABETES RISK]
Women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with approximately 40% and 7.5-10% of women with PCOS having impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM, respectively. The risk of gestational diabetes is also approximately threefold higher in women with PCOS. Obesity can confound these data, but the incidence of PCOS remains increased across ethnicities.

----
[PCOS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
The source of androgens in PCOS is both the adrenal cortex and the ovary, and raised insulin levels can stimulate androgen production by the ovary and interfere with other aspects of ovarian function. Insulin can also influence glucocorticoid versus sex steroid precursor production in the adrenal cortex. Hyperinsulinemia is generally held responsible for the development of PCOS, with raised intracellular calcium limiting cellular glucose uptake.

----
[HYPERPARATHYROIDISM AND GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS]
Hyperparathyroidism can affect glucose homeostasis, and some reports suggest that parathyroidectomy may improve glucose tolerance and reduce the risk of diabetes. However, the effect of hyperparathyroidism on glucose homeostasis may depend on the duration and severity of the calcium disturbance, and further research is needed to fully understand this relationship.
----
[ACROMEGALY AND DIABETES]
Acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone, is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes due to impaired beta-cell function and reduced insulin sensitivity. Studies have shown that acromegalic patients often have impaired glucose tolerance, which can be attributed to the insulin-antagonistic effect of growth hormone. The relationship between acromegaly and diabetes is complex, and further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN ACROMEGALY]
Insulin resistance is a common feature of acromegaly, with defects in both hepatic and extrahepatic insulin action. Growth hormone has been shown to have an insulin-antagonistic effect, which can lead to impaired glucose metabolism. Exercise and agents that improve insulin sensitivity, such as metformin or thiazolidinediones, can help ameliorate insulin resistance and improve glucose tolerance in acromegalic patients.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN ACROMEGALY]
Managing diabetes in patients with acromegaly requires a comprehensive approach, taking into account the complex relationship between growth hormone and glucose metabolism. Agents that improve insulin sensitivity, such as metformin or thiazolidinediones, can be effective in lowering blood glucose levels and improving menstrual regularity in female patients. Additionally, exercise and other lifestyle modifications can help improve insulin sensitivity and overall glucose metabolism.

----
[ENDOCRINE ABNORMALITIES IN ACROMEGALY]
Acromegaly is often associated with endocrine abnormalities, including increases in serum luteinizing hormone (LH), androstenedione, and testosterone concentrations. Serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels are commonly low, and ovarian ultrasound can be useful in excluding underlying tumors that may be contributing to androgen excess. These endocrine abnormalities can have significant implications for diabetes management and overall patient care.
----
[DIABETES AND ENDOCRINE DISORDERS]
Endocrine disorders such as acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, and growth hormone deficiency can have a significant impact on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, leading to the development of diabetes. Treatment of these disorders can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. For example, patients with acromegaly who were converted from depot octreotide to pegvisomant showed improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND GROWTH FACTORS]
Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) plays a role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Studies have shown that IGF-1 treatment can reduce insulin requirements in patients with type 1 diabetes. Additionally, growth factors such as IGF-1 and its binding protein-3 have been shown to have biological activity in reducing insulin resistance.

----
[DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS AND ENDOCRINE DISORDERS]
Certain endocrine disorders, such as Cushing's syndrome, can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and other complications in patients with diabetes. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders are crucial in managing diabetes and preventing long-term complications. For example, Cushing's syndrome can cause insulin resistance and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

----
[ENDOCRINE DISORDERS AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Understanding the relationship between endocrine disorders and diabetes is essential for effective management of the disease. For example, the dawn phenomenon, which is a natural increase in glucose levels in the early morning hours, can have implications for diabetes therapy. Additionally, growth hormone and IGF-1 can play a role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and their levels can be altered in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND ENDOCRINE TUMORS]
Endocrine tumors, such as pheochromocytoma, glucagonoma, and somatostatinoma, can affect glucose metabolism and contribute to the development of diabetes. These tumors can produce excess hormones that interfere with insulin secretion and glucose production in the liver. For example, pheochromocytoma can cause insulin resistance, while glucagonoma can lead to increased hepatic glucose production.

----
[GLUCAGONOMA SYNDROME]
The glucagonoma syndrome is a rare condition characterized by a tumor of the pancreas that produces excess glucagon, leading to hyperglycemia, weight loss, and necrolytic migratory erythema. The syndrome is often associated with diabetes, and treatment typically involves surgical removal of the tumor. The glucagonoma syndrome can also cause glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, making it challenging to manage blood sugar levels.

----
[HYPERTHYROIDISM AND DIABETES]
Hyperthyroidism can induce glucose intolerance by lowering both insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity. This can lead to the development of diabetes or worsen existing diabetes. Studies have shown that hyperthyroidism can decrease insulin secretion and glucose effectiveness, making it essential to manage thyroid hormone levels in patients with diabetes. Additionally, hyperthyroidism can also lead to increased glucose production in the liver, further contributing to hyperglycemia.

----
[SOMATOSTATINOMA]
Somatostatinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas that produces excess somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits insulin secretion. This can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetes, as well as other symptoms such as diarrhea and weight loss. Somatostatinoma can also cause glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, making it challenging to manage blood sugar levels. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the tumor.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME]
The diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have been reappraised, with the Rotterdam criteria being widely used. However, there is controversy surrounding these criteria, with some arguing that they are premature. The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group has revised the diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to PCOS. 
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME]
Insulin resistance is a key feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and it plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the condition. Insulin resistance can lead to hyperinsulinemia, which in turn can contribute to the development of hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction. Understanding the relationship between insulin resistance and PCOS is essential for the diagnosis and management of the condition.
----
[GROWTH HORMONE AND DIABETES]
Growth hormone (GH) therapy has been shown to have effects on insulin action, and there is a potential risk of GH therapy causing diabetes. However, the relationship between GH and diabetes is complex, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of GH therapy on glucose metabolism. GH deficiency has also been linked to changes in body composition, bone mass, and metabolic indices.
----
[ENDOCRINE DISORDERS AND DIABETES]
Endocrine disorders such as hypopituitarism and Cushing's syndrome can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes, particularly in women with insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Understanding the relationship between endocrine disorders and diabetes is essential for the diagnosis and management of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES CAUSED BY PANCREATIC DISEASE]
Pancreatic disease is a rare cause of diabetes, accounting for less than 0.5% of all cases of diabetes. Various pancreatic diseases, such as acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic carcinoma, can lead to diabetes. These conditions can damage both the exocrine and endocrine components of the pancreas, impairing β-cell function.
----
[ACUTE PANCREATITIS AND DIABETES]
Acute pancreatitis can cause transient hyperglycemia, which is usually mild and resolves within days to weeks without needing insulin treatment. However, in severe cases with fulminant disease and multiorgan failure, the incidence of permanent diabetes can approach 25%. Blood glucose levels exceeding 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) during the first 24 hours indicate a poor prognosis.
----
[CHRONIC PANCREATITIS AND DIABETES]
Chronic pancreatitis can lead to permanent diabetes, which is typically difficult to control. Imaging studies often reveal dilated ducts and pancreatic calculi. Tropical calcific pancreatitis, a disease of unknown etiology, is associated with large pancreatic calculi and diabetes.
----
[PANCREATIC CARCINOMA AND DIABETES]
Pancreatic carcinoma can complicate type 2 diabetes, diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis, and fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes. It is essential to suspect malignancy in patients with back pain, jaundice, or weight loss despite good glycemic control.
----
[OTHER PANCREATIC CONDITIONS AND DIABETES]
Hereditary hemochromatosis, an inherited disorder, can produce diabetes secondary to iron deposition in the pancreatic islets and subsequent islet cell damage. Cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder, can also lead to glucose intolerance, with up to 75% of adults with cystic fibrosis having some degree of glucose intolerance.
----
[CHRONIC PANCREATITIS DEFINITION]
Chronic pancreatitis is a condition characterized by progressive and irreversible destruction of the exocrine pancreatic tissue, leading to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and varying degrees of glucose intolerance, which often require insulin. The causes of chronic pancreatitis vary according to geographic location. Alcohol abuse accounts for most cases in Western populations, while tropical pancreatitis is a distinct form prevalent in the developing world.

----
[CHRONIC PANCREATITIS CAUSES]
The causes of chronic pancreatitis include alcohol abuse, idiopathic, tropical calcific pancreatitis, hereditary chronic pancreatitis, and obstructive chronic pancreatitis. Hereditary chronic pancreatitis is a rare entity, inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, with mutations in genes such as PRSS1, SPINK1, and CFTR. Obstructive chronic pancreatitis is a rare condition that follows occlusion of pancreatic ducts by tumors, scarring, pseudocysts, or congenital anomalies.

----
[CHRONIC PANCREATITIS EPIDEMIOLOGY]
Chronic pancreatitis is prevalent worldwide, with an incidence of about 4 cases per year per 100,000 population in Western countries. The condition affects two distinct age groups, one with onset at 15-25 years and the other at 55-65 years. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor, and mutations in specific genes have also been postulated.

----
[DIABETES ASSOCIATION]
Chronic pancreatitis can lead to glucose intolerance and diabetes, with up to 11% of patients with ketoacidosis developing chronic pancreatitis, usually with mild or no abdominal pain. The condition is associated with pancreatic diseases, including inflammatory, infiltrative, and neoplastic conditions, as well as surgical resection or trauma.
----
[CHRONIC PANCREATITIS AND DIABETES]
Chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes due to the progressive fibrosis and atrophy of the pancreatic acini, resulting in a decrease in the number of islets and overall reduction in β-cell density and insulin immunoreactivity. The clinical features of chronic pancreatitis include abdominal pain, which is usually steady and boring, and located in the epigastrium or left hypochondrium. The pain may be relieved by bending forward or assuming the knee-chest position. The development of end-stage pancreatic disease is associated with the disappearance of pain in many cases.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES OF CHRONIC PANCREATITIS]
The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis can be confirmed by demonstrating pancreatic calculi on a plain X-ray of the abdomen, or by using ultrasonography, CT scanning, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP is considered the gold standard and usually reveals irregular dilatation of the pancreatic ducts with filling defects caused by stones. CT scanning shows patchy increases in parenchymal density and, ultimately, atrophy of the gland.
----
[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF CHRONIC PANCREATITIS]
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency may manifest with steatorrhea and features of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The combination of oily and greasy stools with diabetes should raise the suspicion of chronic pancreatitis. Steatorrhea may not be apparent on a low-fat diet, making it essential to consider other diagnostic criteria.
----
[PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN CHRONIC PANCREATITIS]
The pathological changes in chronic pancreatitis include a decrease in the number of β-cells, an increase in the number of α-cells, and an altered β-cell to α-cell ratio. The β-cell to α-cell ratio is typically reduced, ranging from 0.6 to 2.5, compared to controls, which range from 3.0 to 3.5. Additionally, there may be an increase in the number of PP cells, while δ-cells remain unchanged.
----
[CHRONIC PANCREATITIS IMAGING]
Figure 18.3 shows the characteristic patterns of pancreatic calculi in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis and fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes. The images reveal thickened echogenic duct walls, a grossly dilated ductal system, and calculi occluding the duct. These patterns are distinct in each condition, allowing for differential diagnosis. 

----
[INVESTIGATIONS IN CHRONIC PANCREATITIS]
Investigations in chronic pancreatitis include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) and ultrasound scans. ERCP can show dilatation and irregularity of the pancreatic ductal system, while ultrasound scans can demonstrate highly echogenic parenchyma and duct walls, grossly dilated ducts, and calculi. These diagnostic tools help in assessing the extent of pancreatic damage and guiding treatment.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN MALABSORPTION]
Malabsorption can be effectively treated with a low-fat diet and pancreatic enzyme supplements, along with histamine H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors to block gastric acid secretion. High carbohydrate and protein intakes are encouraged, along with fat restriction, to prevent steatorrhea. Over 80% of patients require insulin, but the required doses are typically low, around 30-40 units/day.
----
[TROPICAL CALCIFIC PANCREATITIS]
Tropical calcific pancreatitis is a distinct variety of chronic pancreatitis seen predominantly in low and middle-income countries, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, pancreatic calculi, and ductal dilatation. The disease usually starts in childhood and progresses to frank diabetes in more than 90% of patients by adulthood. However, it remains a rare cause of diabetes, constituting less than 1% of all cases.
----
[DIABETES IN CHRONIC PANCREATITIS]
Abnormal glucose tolerance and diabetes complicate around 40-50% of cases of chronic pancreatitis, due to damage to the β-cells. The diabetes is of insidious onset and usually occurs several years after the onset of pain, with half or more of patients requiring insulin for optimal glycemic control. However, ketoacidosis is rare, even if insulin is withdrawn, due to better preservation of β-cell function and reduced glucagon secretion.
----
[EXOCRINE PANCREATIC FUNCTION ASSESSMENT]
Exocrine pancreatic function can be assessed by measuring the urinary excretion of compounds liberated in the gut by pancreatic enzyme action, such as NBT-PABA or fluorescein dilaurate. Screening tests of pancreatic enzymes, such as fecal chymotrypsin or fecal elastase, are also used, although they are less specific. Measurement of pancreatic output via a tube placed in the duodenum may also be helpful.
----
[DIABETES IN TROPICAL CALCIFIC PANCREATITIS]
Tropical calcific pancreatitis is a condition that often progresses to diabetes, with over 90% of patients developing the disease. The disease typically evolves from euglycemia to impaired glucose tolerance and eventually to frank diabetes. Most patients with tropical calcific pancreatitis require insulin, but are generally not prone to ketosis.
----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF TROPICAL CALCIFIC PANCREATITIS]
The classic clinical triad of tropical calcific pancreatitis consists of abdominal pain, steatorrhea, and eventually diabetes. Patients may also experience intractable pain or significant weight loss, which can be indicative of pancreatic malignancy. The disease often progresses steadily, and most patients require insulin therapy.
----
[MANAGEMENT OF TROPICAL CALCIFIC PANCREATITIS AND FCPD]
The management of tropical calcific pancreatitis and fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD) is similar to that of chronic pancreatitis. Treatment may involve insulin therapy, oral antidiabetic agents, or dietary changes, depending on the individual patient's needs.
----
[GENETIC ETIOLOGY OF TROPICAL CALCIFIC PANCREATITIS]
Tropical calcific pancreatitis may have a genetic etiology, with cases clustering in families and an association with the SPINK1 gene. However, the exact cause of the disease is still not fully understood, and further research is needed to determine the role of genetic and environmental factors.

[HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS AND DIABETES]
Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that can increase the risk of developing diabetes, as well as other conditions such as cirrhosis and bronzed hyperpigmentation. The condition is characterized by iron overload, and diabetes is a common complication of the disease.
----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF HEMOCHROMATOSIS]
The classic clinical features of hemochromatosis include hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes, and skin hyperpigmentation, also known as "bronzed diabetes". Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis usually develop after age 40, unless other factors such as alcoholism are present. Presenting symptoms include weakness, weight loss, diabetic symptoms, and skin pigmentation.

----
[DIABETES IN PRIMARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS]
The prevalence of diabetes in primary hemochromatosis depends on the severity of iron overload and presence of cirrhosis. Up to 50% of patients have glucose intolerance and 25% have overt diabetes, with both insulin resistance and β-cell failure contributing to the development of diabetes. Most patients eventually require insulin and are prone to microvascular and macrovascular complications.

----
[ETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF HEMOCHROMATOSIS]
Most cases of primary hemochromatosis arise from mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE), located on the short arm of chromosome 6. The HFE protein modulates iron absorption by binding to the transferrin receptor, and mutations such as C282Y and H63D can lead to excessive and inappropriate increase in intestinal iron absorption. These mutations inhibit the binding of HFE to transferrin, resulting in greatly increased body iron stores.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HEMOCHROMATOSIS]
The primary defect in hemochromatosis is excessive iron absorption across the mucosa of the proximal small intestine, which continues even in the setting of greatly increased total body iron stores. Excess iron is deposited preferentially in the liver, pancreas, pituitary, heart, and parathyroids, leading to tissue injury through rupture of iron-laden lysosomes, generation of free radicals, and stimulation of collagen synthesis by activated stellate cells.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF HEMOCHROMATOSIS]
The diagnosis of hemochromatosis should be suspected in patients with diabetes, hepatomegaly, liver disease, skin pigmentation, arthritis, and hypogonadism. A high index of suspicion is required to make an early diagnosis, as significant iron overload can exist with few or no clinical manifestations. Serum ferritin and percent saturation of transferrin can be used to assess total-body iron stores. 
----
[SCREENING TESTS FOR HEMOCHROMATOSIS]
Serum ferritin is a useful screening test for relatives of affected individuals, but abnormally high results should be confirmed by other tests. A combined measurement of percent transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels provides a simple and reliable screening test for hemochromatosis, and a positive test mandates genetic testing. 
----
[TREATMENT OF HEMOCHROMATOSIS]
Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis is by repeated venesection, which must be started as early as possible to prevent diabetes and cirrhosis and prolong survival. Removal of excess iron by venesection can normalize life expectancy if started before the onset of cirrhosis or diabetes. 
----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF HEMOCHROMATOSIS]
The classic triad of hereditary hemochromatosis comprises diabetes, cirrhosis, and hyperpigmentation of the skin, also known as "bronzed diabetes". Other clinical features include hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, chondrocalcinosis, pseudogout, and cardiomyopathy. 
----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY TREATMENT]
Early treatment of hemochromatosis is crucial to prevent complications such as diabetes and cirrhosis. If treatment is started before the onset of these conditions, life expectancy can be normalized, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and intervention.
----
[DIABETES AFTER PANCREATECTOMY]
Diabetes caused by pancreatic surgery is usually difficult to control, with wide excursions in blood glucose levels. Patients are highly insulin-sensitive and prone to hypoglycemia due to the loss of glucagon function. Frequent small meals and multiple small doses of insulin can help minimize these problems, and the use of a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump may be beneficial in some cases.
----
[CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND DIABETES]
Cystic fibrosis is a multisystem disease that can lead to pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes. The incidence of diabetes in children with cystic fibrosis is 2-3%, which is about 20 times higher than in the general population. The major factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes in cystic fibrosis is damage to the pancreatic β-cells secondary to exocrine pancreatic degeneration.
----
[MANAGING DIABETES IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS]
Diabetes in cystic fibrosis is often complicated by hypoglycemia caused by concomitant α-cell damage and glucagon deficiency. Management of diabetes in cystic fibrosis may require insulin treatment, and patients may benefit from a diet low in fat and high in carbohydrate and protein. Pancreatic enzyme therapy can help control steatorrhea and stabilize blood glucose levels.
----
[SECONDARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS AND DIABETES]
Secondary hemochromatosis, which can occur in conditions such as thalassemia major, may lead to massive iron overload and pancreatic damage, resulting in diabetes. The duration of disease and number of transfusions correlate well with the degree of glucose intolerance, and iron overload may induce an autoimmune attack against the β-cells, contributing to the development of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND PANCREATITIS]
Diabetes can develop in patients with pancreatitis, and the relationship between the two conditions is complex. Pancreatitis can lead to damage to the pancreatic islets, resulting in diabetes. Additionally, some studies suggest that certain genetic mutations, such as those associated with cystic fibrosis, can increase the risk of developing both pancreatitis and diabetes.

----
[GENETIC MUTATIONS AND DIABETES]
Certain genetic mutations, such as the Δ508 mutation, can increase the risk of developing diabetes, particularly in patients with pancreatitis. Diabetes develops more commonly in patients homozygous for the Δ508 mutation than in heterozygotes. This suggests that genetic factors can play a significant role in the development of diabetes in patients with pancreatitis.

----
[CLINICAL ASPECTS OF PANCREATIC DIABETES]
Pancreatic diabetes, also known as diabetes associated with pancreatitis, has distinct clinical and hormonal characteristics. The onset of diabetes is usually insidious, and the condition is often characterized by a delayed and fluctuating course. Understanding the clinical aspects of pancreatic diabetes is essential for providing effective management and treatment.

----
[PATHOLOGY OF PANCREATIC ISLETS]
The pathology of pancreatic islets in patients with pancreatitis and diabetes is complex and involves damage to the islets and inflammation. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown that the endocrine pancreas is affected in chronic pancreatitis, leading to impaired insulin secretion and glucose regulation.
----
[DIABETES AND PANCREATITIS ASSOCIATION]
Research has identified a significant association between mutations in the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene (PSTI/SPINK1) and tropical calcific pancreatitis, which is often linked to diabetes. Studies have shown that SPINK1 mutations are more commonly found in patients with tropical pancreatitis and diabetes from Bangladesh and other parts of the Indian subcontinent. This suggests a possible genetic component to the development of diabetes in these populations.

----
[HEMOCHROMATOSIS AND DIABETES]
Hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation in the body, has been linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes. Studies have shown that patients with hemochromatosis are more likely to develop diabetes, and that the disease can cause pancreatic damage and impair insulin function. The HFE gene mutations C282Y and H63D have been identified as risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy in patients with hemochromatosis.

----
[TROPICAL PANCREATIC DIABETES]
Tropical pancreatic diabetes is a distinct form of diabetes that is prevalent in certain regions, including South India. Research has shown that this form of diabetes is characterized by pancreatic damage and impaired insulin function, and is often associated with genetic mutations such as SPINK1. The clinical and biochemical features of tropical pancreatic diabetes can vary, and further research is needed to understand the underlying causes and risk factors for this condition.
----
[DIABETES IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS]
Diabetes is a common complication in patients with cystic fibrosis, with studies suggesting that insulin therapy can improve lung function and reduce infections in these patients. Research has also shown that patients with cystic fibrosis have enhanced glucose absorption in the jejunum, which can contribute to the development of diabetes. Additionally, genotype analysis has been used to investigate the relationship between cystic fibrosis and the occurrence of diabetes mellitus.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS]
Insulin therapy has been shown to improve the clinical status of patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus. Studies have demonstrated that insulin can help to improve lung function and reduce the frequency of infections in these patients. Furthermore, insulin therapy has been found to be effective in managing diabetes in patients with cystic fibrosis, highlighting the importance of proper diabetes management in this population.

----
[DIABETES AND PANCREATIC DISEASE]
There is a significant relationship between diabetes and pancreatic disease, with diabetes being a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Research has shown that patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and that alterations in glucose metabolism can be an early sign of pancreatic cancer. Additionally, pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma can also contribute to the development of diabetes.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES IN PANCREATIC DISEASE]
Oral pancreatic enzyme therapy has been used to control diabetes mellitus in patients with tropical calculous pancreatitis. This approach highlights the importance of managing pancreatic exocrine dysfunction in patients with diabetes and pancreatic disease. Furthermore, proper management of diabetes is crucial in patients with pancreatic disease to prevent complications and improve outcomes.
----
[DIABETES PRESENTATION]
Patients with type 1 diabetes usually present with classic symptoms such as thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria, and may occasionally experience diabetic ketoacidosis. In contrast, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may be asymptomatic or present with classic symptoms. The presentation of T2DM can also be discovered on routine examination or laboratory test, and may be asymptomatic for years, allowing the clinical presentation to be a long-term complication of diabetes.

----
[CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS]
At the heart of any consultation involving the presentation of diabetes, it is essential to establish the patient's beliefs and thoughts on diabetes. The patient's prior knowledge and associations with diabetes can impact their understanding and prognosis. A therapeutic consultation involves listening to the patient, which can help put their type of diabetes and immediate prognosis into perspective. This process can transform the patient's view of the consultation and is valued by patients as an essential attribute of a doctor.

----
[DIABETES TYPES AND SYMPTOMS]
The classic triad of thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria accounts for only a modest proportion of new diagnoses of diabetes. Non-specific symptoms, including tiredness, general malaise, and repeated or persistent skin infections, may lead to a biochemical diagnosis of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by a relatively acute onset of symptoms, including loss of weight, and may be accompanied by ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome.

----
[EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING]
Screening of at-risk groups or individuals allows for early diagnosis of diabetes. Early diagnosis is crucial, as diabetes can remain asymptomatic for years, allowing the clinical presentation to be a long-term complication of diabetes. Pregnancy may cause gestational diabetes (GDM), which, although it may remit after delivery, indicates a high risk for future type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
----
[DIABETES SYMPTOMS]
The symptoms of diabetes can vary, but a careful history documenting the time course of symptoms and any change in intake of specific drinks is important. Patients may experience thirst and nocturia, and the number of times urine is passed at night should be quantified. A simple question like "Do you need to drink water when you get up at night?" can be a reasonably objective measure of thirst. This information can help healthcare providers understand the severity of the symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan.

----
[RENAL THRESHOLD AND GLUCOSURIA]
For glucose to escape into the urine, plasma glucose concentration must exceed the renal threshold for tubular reabsorption of glucose, which averages 11 mmol/L but displays a wide individual variation. The maximum absorptive capacity varies with age, with older people exhibiting glycosuria at higher plasma glucose levels. This is clinically significant, as older people will only develop osmotic symptoms at higher plasma glucose levels, making diagnosis and treatment more challenging.

----
[AGE-RELATED CHANGES IN DIABETES SYMPTOMS]
The rise in maximum renal tubular absorptive capacity with increasing age is clinically significant, as older people will only develop osmotic symptoms at higher plasma glucose levels. Additionally, the threshold for triggering the sensation of thirst rises with advancing years, making it more difficult for older people to sense dehydration. These age-related changes are highly relevant to the development of severe hyperosmolar states and highlight the importance of careful monitoring and management of diabetes in older adults.

----
[CHRONIC HYPERGLYCEMIA AND RENAL SENSITIVITY]
The presence of chronic hyperglycemia itself changes the renal sensitivity to vasopressin, such that thirst is not appreciated despite rising plasma osmolarity. This can lead to delayed appropriate action to increase oral fluid intake as dehydration progresses, particularly in older people with undiagnosed diabetes. Healthcare providers should be aware of this potential complication and take steps to prevent dehydration in patients with diabetes.

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF DIABETES]
The clinical features identified from the history at presentation will vary in relation to factors such as age and renal function. In older people, thirst may be experienced despite an osmotic diuresis, and polydipsia may be absent. The most reliably quantitated feature of an osmotic presentation is therefore frequency of nocturia, and specifically an increase from habitual levels. In children, enuresis may be the first symptom of polyuria, and sudden onset of enuresis should always prompt testing of urine for glucose.

----
[WEIGHT LOSS AND DIABETES]
Establishing whether significant weight loss has occurred is the most important aspect of history-taking in those with newly presenting diabetes. Weight loss can be a significant symptom of diabetes, and healthcare providers should investigate the cause of weight loss and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In some cases, diabetes can be cured or ameliorated with treatment, and healthcare providers should be aware of the possibilities for cure or improvement.
----
[CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS OF DIABETES]
The clinical presentations of diabetes can vary depending on the type, with type 1 diabetes often presenting with severe wasting of muscle and adipose tissue due to insulin deficiency. Weight loss is a prominent feature of type 1 diabetes, especially if presentation is delayed. The speed of restoration of body mass on replacing insulin can be impressive, as seen in the example of a 3-year-old boy who showed significant improvement after 3 months of insulin therapy.

----
[DIABETES TYPES AND CLINICAL FEATURES]
The clinical features of type 1, type 2, and monogenic diabetes can be used as a diagnostic guide, although there may be exceptions due to specific circumstances. Type 1 diabetes is often characterized by weight loss, ketonuria, and a rapid time course of symptoms, while type 2 diabetes typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and no ketonuria unless recent fasting has occurred. Monogenic diabetes, on the other hand, may not exhibit severe symptoms and often has a family history of the condition.

----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND FAMILY HISTORY]
Family history can play a role in the diagnosis of diabetes, with type 1 diabetes possibly having a family history of insulin dependence at a young age, and type 2 diabetes having a present family history in 30% of cases with onset in adult life. Monogenic diabetes, however, often has a family history of the condition, present in almost all cases with onset in childhood or adult life. Pancreatic diabetes, on the other hand, may only have a family history by chance, except in association with hemochromatosis.

----
[AGE OF ONSET FOR DIFFERENT DIABETES TYPES]
The age of onset for different types of diabetes can vary, with type 1 diabetes typically peaking in preschool and teenage years but can present at any age. Type 2 diabetes usually presents after the age of 20 years, while monogenic diabetes can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adult life. Pancreatic diabetes, however, is more common in middle-aged and older individuals.
----
[INFECTIONS AND DIABETES]
Recurrent or refractory yeast infections, such as vaginal candidiasis in women or balanitis in men, may be a sign of previously undiagnosed diabetes. Initial control of blood glucose levels can help clear the infection with continued antifungal treatment. Staphylococcal infections, such as pustules, boils, and carbuncles, may also be present at the diagnosis of diabetes, especially Type 1 diabetes.
----
[SERIOUS INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Necrotizing fasciitis, Fournier gangrene, and mucormycosis are rare but serious infections that are more common in people with diabetes. These infections can be fatal if left untreated, and it is essential to consider them in patients with diabetes. Fournier gangrene is associated with diabetes in almost 50% of cases, and mucormycosis is most often associated with diabetes.
----
[DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS]
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs due to marked insulin deficiency and an increase in counter-regulatory hormones. It is characterized by hyperglycemia, acidosis, and ketonuria, and mainly occurs in patients with Type 1 diabetes, but can also occur in some patients with Type 2 diabetes. The overall mortality rate from DKA ranges from 2-5%, but is higher in the elderly.
----
[SYMPTOMS OF DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS]
DKA typically presents with symptoms of hyperglycemia, such as thirst, polyuria, and polydipsia, as well as malaise, lethargy, and muscle cramps. Abdominal pain and vomiting may be severe enough to mimic an acute surgical problem, and it is crucial to recognize these symptoms to avoid fatal outcomes. Clinical signs include dehydration, deep respirations, and a sweet-smelling breath odor caused by ketones.
----
[WEIGHT LOSS AND DIABETES]
Weight loss at presentation is a common symptom of Type 1 diabetes, but its absence does not exclude the diagnosis. In Type 2 diabetes, weight loss may occur due to dietary restriction, but typically, weight does not change or continues to rise prior to the symptomatic onset of the disease. The weight loss in diabetes reflects the relative loss of the anabolic actions of insulin, and muscle wasting may be prominent, especially in young men.
----
[DIABETES PRESENTATION IN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often presents for the first time at hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), complicated by stress hyperglycemia due to catecholamine and cortisol elevations. Stress hyperglycemia and established diabetes have similarly increased mortality from AMI, with a 3.9-fold increase in risk of death associated with stress hyperglycemia compared to a 1.7-fold increase with established diabetes. The 3-year mortality rate in patients with AMI and stress hyperglycemia was 52%, compared to 42% in those with diabetes and 24% in those with normal glucose levels.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT IN AMI]
Reasonable glycemic management, with blood glucose levels below 10 mmol/L, can improve mortality by 52% in patients with no prior insulin therapy and low coronary risk factors, including those with stress hyperglycemia. In contrast, acute blood glucose control showed no significant benefit for individuals previously treated with insulin. Estimates of the incidence of stress hyperglycemia at presentation of AMI range from 10-16%, while the prevalence of diabetes at presentation of AMI is estimated to be 25-32%.
----
[CLINICAL PRACTICE FOR DIABETES SCREENING IN AMI]
Good clinical practice demands measurement of plasma glucose on diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome, with further testing including fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c if plasma glucose is raised. Raised plasma glucose indicates a need for particular attention to adequate glucose control during the acute event, with rapid control critical in the first few hours. A fasting plasma glucose of >5.6 mmol/L or admission plasma glucose of >7.8 mmol/L can help detect diabetes with high sensitivity and positive predictive value.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC UNCERTAINTY AND TARGETED SCREENING]
In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, targeted screening with a standard 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is acceptable, with good correlation between pre-discharge and 6-week post-discharge OGTTs. The optimal time to perform this test is not specified, but both pre-discharge and 6-week post-discharge OGTTs can be used to detect diabetes in patients with no previous diagnosis.
----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY]
Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, with approximately 8% of men and 4% of women in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) found to have marked retinopathy at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Early recognition and treatment of diabetes is essential to prevent worsening of retinopathy. The severity of retinopathy is related to higher fasting plasma glucose levels, and increased alcohol consumption has also been linked to increased severity in men.
----
[DIABETES AND STROKE]
The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes in patients with acute stroke is 8-28%, and an additional 6-42% have unrecognized pre-existing dysglycemia. Plasma glucose at presentation is a major prognostic factor, with full functional recovery at 4 weeks restricted to those with presenting blood glucose levels < 8 mmol/L. Hyperglycemia has been shown to impair subsequent recovery from ischemic damage.
----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA AND STROKE OUTCOME]
Persistent hyperglycemia (defined as blood glucose > 7.0 mmol/L) in the 72 hours after acute stroke has been found to be associated with an increase in infarct size and worse stroke outcome. However, there are currently no satisfactory outcome studies of control of plasma glucose upon the outcome of stroke, and further research is needed to determine the optimal management of hyperglycemia in acute stroke.
----
[EARLY GLUCOSE CONTROL IN STROKE]
Early control of plasma glucose in the first few hours after presentation with acute stroke may be beneficial, but no assessment has yet been conducted on the impact of glucose control during this time period. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal timing and targets for glucose control in acute stroke.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
The presentation of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is influenced by the physiologic insulin resistance that develops during pregnancy, typically around 18 weeks' gestation. Insulin requirements increase linearly until around 28 weeks' gestation, with an average increase in daily insulin dose of 40%. Screening for GDM is most sensitive later in pregnancy, and current guidelines recommend testing at 24-28 weeks' gestation. 
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS RISK]
Women who have had GDM are at increased risk of developing subsequent diabetes, ranging from 2.6 to 70% over periods from 6 weeks to 28 years. The risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy is also increased, particularly in South Asian and Hispanic populations. Early diagnosis of GDM carries major advantages for mother and child, and current guidelines recommend annual screening for those with a history of GDM.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF GDM SCREENING]
Mild degrees of elevation of plasma glucose can be deleterious to the fetus, making screening for GDM essential. Symptomatic presentation of GDM is unusual in healthcare systems with universal screening, but when symptoms do occur, it is important to distinguish between new-onset GDM, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. 
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
The potential severity of diabetic retinopathy at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is significant, with 15% of those with moderate background retinopathy progressing to require photocoagulation therapy within 3 years. Maculopathy and proliferative retinopathy are common indications for photocoagulation therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING]
The diagnosis of diabetes can be made through various screening procedures, but the population of individuals with early type 2 diabetes who are identified by any screening procedure differs considerably from those who present symptomatically. They are less likely to have established microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes. Screening tests such as fasting glucose, 2-hour post-challenge glucose, and HbA1c can be used to predict future microvascular complications of diabetes.

----
[PRESENTING FEATURES OF DIABETES]
The presenting features of diabetes can be varied, including ants clustering around urine, periodontal disease, cataracts, altered taste, and excess production of saliva. These features may not be immediately recognized as symptoms of diabetes, and healthcare professionals must be vigilant in diagnosing the condition effectively. Failure to recognize presenting features of diabetes can be costly for the patient.

----
[SCREENING HIGH-RISK GROUPS]
It is recommended that screening of high-risk groups, such as obese individuals, those with a strong family history of diabetes, and individuals of South Asian or other high-risk ethnicity, should be undertaken. Universal screening has not been implemented in the UK, as criteria for cost-effective and clinically effective screening are not met. However, screening high-risk groups can help identify individuals with undiagnosed diabetes.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS]
Early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial, as it can help prevent or delay the onset of microvascular and macrovascular complications. The mode of presentation of diabetes is enormously varied, and healthcare professionals must be aware of the different presenting features to diagnose the condition effectively. The incidence of diabetes is rising in all age groups, making early diagnosis and treatment even more important.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
Diabetes is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and patients with acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction often have undiagnosed diabetes or insulin resistance. Studies have shown that diabetes and stress hyperglycemia are associated with increased mortality and worse outcomes in patients with acute stroke or myocardial infarction. Early recognition and management of hyperglycemia are crucial in improving outcomes in these patients.

----
[DIABETES AND STROKE]
Stress hyperglycemia is common in patients with acute stroke, and its presence is associated with increased infarct size and worse clinical outcomes. The management of hyperglycemia in acute stroke is critical, and glucose-potassium-insulin infusions have been shown to be effective in improving outcomes. However, the optimal management strategy for hyperglycemia in acute stroke is still a topic of debate.

----
[DIABETES AND MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and its severity is associated with the risk of progression to photocoagulation. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has shown that the risk of retinopathy is related to the duration of diabetes and the level of glycemic control. Regular screening for retinopathy is essential in patients with diabetes to prevent visual impairment.

----
[DIABETES AND PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY]
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, affecting up to 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes. The risk factors for neuropathy include the duration of diabetes, the level of glycemic control, and the presence of other microvascular complications. Early recognition and management of neuropathy are crucial in preventing foot ulcers and other complications.

----
[DIABETES AND FOOT ULCERS]
Foot ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, and their presence is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The prevention of foot ulcers requires regular foot care, including inspection, debridement, and off-loading of high-pressure areas. Patients with diabetes should be educated on the importance of foot care and the recognition of early signs of foot ulcers.

----
[DIABETES AND PREGNANCY]
Women with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and congenital malformations. Tight glycemic control is essential in improving outcomes in pregnant women with diabetes. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin therapy are critical in preventing complications and ensuring a healthy pregnancy.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR DIABETES]
Diagnostic methods for diabetes include tests for glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, and two-hour plasma glucose concentrations. These tests are used to diagnose and classify diabetes mellitus. The expert committee on the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus has established guidelines for these diagnostic methods. 
----
[PREVALENCE OF DIABETES]
The global prevalence of diabetes is estimated to be high, with projections indicating an increase in the number of people with diabetes by 2030. According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of diabetes is a significant public health concern. Studies have estimated the probability of undiagnosed disease in various populations, including those in dental offices. 
----
[DIABETES IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS]
Type 1 diabetes and pregnancy is a significant concern, as it can affect both the mother and the fetus. Gestational diabetes mellitus is also a concern, as it can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. Intrauterine growth rate can be affected by pregnancies complicated by type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. 
----
[SCREENING FOR DIABETES]
Screening for diabetes is an important aspect of public health, as it can help identify undiagnosed cases and prevent complications. The National Screening Committee has established policies for diabetes screening in adults, including the use of electronic records to identify patients with undiagnosed diabetes. Cross-sectional surveys have been used to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in various populations. 
----
[COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES]
Diabetes can increase the risk of various complications, including cardiovascular disease, selected cardiovascular disease risk factors, and age-related cataract and progression of lens opacities. Oral manifestations of previously undiagnosed non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus can also occur. Studies have investigated the relationship between diabetes and these complications.
----
[DIABETES CARE PHILOSOPHY]
The optimal management of diabetes occurs when the multidisciplinary diabetes care team actively involves the person with diabetes as an equal partner in their care. People with diabetes should be seen as individuals with a condition that has medical, personal, and social consequences, rather than being passive recipients of health care. This approach recognizes the central role of the person with diabetes in managing their condition.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT GOALS]
The aims of diabetes care and management are fourfold, including managing life-threatening diabetes emergencies, addressing acute symptoms of hyperglycemia, minimizing long-term complications, and supporting the person with diabetes to achieve improved glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factor management. Regular lifelong contact between the person with diabetes and their healthcare team is essential to support them in coping with the demands of a complex condition that changes throughout life.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF PATIENT INVOLVEMENT]
The person living with diabetes will spend the vast majority of their time managing their diabetes, with only an estimated 1% of their time in contact with healthcare professionals. Therefore, it is essential to support the person with diabetes to take on much of the responsibility for managing their condition, and to ensure that the purposes of consultations or other contacts with the diabetes healthcare team are well-defined and clear.

----
[REDUCING LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS]
High-quality randomized trials have shown that improving glycemic control is associated with a reduction in microvascular complications, while a multifaceted approach to cardiovascular risk factors will reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Much of diabetes management is focused on reducing the risk of long-term complications through screening and supporting the achievement of improved glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factor management.
----
[ST. VINCENT DECLARATION]
The St. Vincent Declaration was a pivotal event in 1989 where representatives from European countries, diabetes organizations, and the World Health Organization (WHO) met to discuss diabetes care. They agreed on recommendations for diabetes care, emphasizing the importance of a partnership between people with diabetes and healthcare professionals. This declaration marked a shift in the perception of diabetes care, recognizing individuals with diabetes as equal partners in their treatment. Since then, this philosophy has been adopted in national strategies to improve diabetes care.

----
[DIABETES CARE TEAM]
A diabetes care team is a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals that supports individuals with diabetes. The team includes diabetes physicians, nurses, educators, dietitians, and other specialists who work together to provide comprehensive care. The person with diabetes is at the center of the care team, working as an equal member to receive information, advice, and education. This collaborative approach ensures that individuals with diabetes receive the support they need to manage their condition effectively.

----
[GOALS OF DIABETES CARE]
The goals of diabetes care include detecting and controlling diabetes, as well as preventing its complications. This involves raising awareness among the population and healthcare professionals, organizing training and education, and providing specialized care for children with diabetes. Additionally, the goals include promoting independence and self-sufficiency for individuals with diabetes, removing barriers to social integration, and implementing measures to prevent costly complications such as blindness, renal failure, and limb amputations.

----
[PREVENTION OF DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
The prevention of diabetes complications is a key aspect of diabetes care. This includes reducing new blindness caused by diabetes by one-third or more, decreasing the number of people entering end-stage renal failure by at least one-third, and cutting the rate of limb amputations in half. Furthermore, vigorous programs aim to reduce morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease, promoting overall health and well-being for individuals with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES CARE OBJECTIVES]
The primary goal of diabetes care is to empower individuals with diabetes to take control of their condition, ensuring that care is tailored to their unique needs and circumstances. This involves a multidisciplinary approach, with a team of healthcare professionals working together to support the person with diabetes. Effective care requires clear roles and responsibilities, as well as collaboration between primary and secondary healthcare professionals.

----
[DIABETES CARE SETTINGS]
Most routine diabetes care takes place in a primary care setting, but individuals with complex needs may require management and support in a specialist setting. The diabetes care team may include a diabetes physician, ophthalmologist, and other specialists, all working together to provide comprehensive care. A close collaboration between healthcare professionals is essential to ensure integrated and coordinated care.

----
[CONTINUITY OF CARE]
Continuity of care is essential for individuals with diabetes, as it allows for consistent management and support. Ideally, care should be provided by the same doctors and nurses at each visit, but when this is not possible, access to previous records is crucial to ensure that healthcare professionals are aware of the individual's medical history and background.

----
[RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES]
Individuals with diabetes play a crucial role in their own care, as they are responsible for implementing their day-to-day management plan. This can be challenging, but the diabetes care team should be available to provide support and guidance. It is essential for healthcare professionals to accept and respect the individual's role in managing their condition.

----
[IMPROVING CONSULTATION OUTCOMES]
To make the most of limited consultation time, both individuals with diabetes and healthcare professionals should prepare for clinic visits. This includes writing down important questions, listing medications, and detailing symptoms. Effective communication is key, and individuals should not hesitate to ask questions or seek clarification if they do not understand something.

Nutritional management in diabetes aims to optimize metabolic control and reduce risk factors for chronic complications by achieving blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels as close to normal as possible. This also includes managing serum lipid concentrations and blood pressure values to decrease the risk of macrovascular disease. Individual therapeutic needs and quality of life should be considered when defining nutritional objectives. 

----
[KEY DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS]
Vegetables, legumes, fruits, and wholegrain cereal-based foods should be part of the diet due to their high dietary fiber content, low glycemic index or load, and range of micronutrients. Saturated, trans-unsaturated fatty acids, and dietary cholesterol should be restricted to reduce the risk of vascular disease, while oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and oily fish rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are useful fat sources.

----
[PROTEIN AND ALCOHOL INTAKE GUIDELINES]
In patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes without evidence of nephropathy, usual protein intake (up to 20% of the total energy intake) does not need to be modified. However, in those with established nephropathy, protein restriction to 0.8 g/kg normal body weight per day may be beneficial. Additionally, alcohol intake should be moderate, and foods naturally rich in dietary antioxidants, trace elements, and other vitamins are encouraged.

----
[EVIDENCE-BASED DIETARY ADVICE]
Diabetes healthcare teams should use the best available scientific evidence when giving dietary advice to individuals with diabetes. Evidence-based nutritional recommendations involve a formal search of the literature and grading of evidence according to the type and quality of published studies, as well as statements from expert committees and clinical experiences of respected authorities.
----
[DIET AND LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS]
Lifestyle interventions, including diet and weight loss, are an effective therapeutic strategy for achieving target glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Modest weight loss, especially in abdominal fat, improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and reduces serum lipid concentrations and blood pressure. Weight loss may also lead to greater benefit for cardiac risk factors in people with a high waist circumference. 

----
[WEIGHT MANAGEMENT]
Prevention of weight regain is an important target in those who have lost some excess weight, and long-term restricted energy intake is necessary to sustain the metabolic improvements that can be achieved by weight reduction. Even overweight patients with type 1 diabetes may become insulin resistant, and weight reduction in these people may lead to a decrease of the insulin dose and improved glycemic control.

----
[NUTRITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS]
The American Diabetes Association and other organizations recommend nutritional guidelines for persons with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including energy balance and body weight management, carbohydrate intake, and dietary fat and protein recommendations. The guidelines suggest that low glycemic index foods, fiber intake, and moderate amounts of free sugars are beneficial for achieving glycemic control.

----
[MACRONUTRIENT INTAKE]
Specific recommendations for macronutrient intake include limiting saturated and trans-unsaturated fatty acids to less than 10% of total energy, dietary cholesterol to less than 300 mg/day, and protein to 0.8 g/kg normal body weight in patients with type 1 diabetes and established nephropathy. Additionally, salt intake should be limited to less than 6 g/day, and routine supplementation with vitamins and minerals is not advised.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA TREATMENT]
The preferred treatment for hypoglycemia is 15-20 g of glucose, and other glucose-containing carbohydrates are also possible. Patients using rapid-acting insulin should adjust their meal and snack insulin based on the carbohydrate content of meals and snacks.
----
[NUTRITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DIABETES]
The American Diabetes Association recommends that individuals with diabetes consume wholegrain, high-fiber cereal-based foods, and choose carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and low-fat milk. The use of glycemic index and load may provide additional benefits. Consumption of a variety of fiber-containing foods is also recommended.

----
[DIETARY FAT RECOMMENDATIONS]
Oils rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids are encouraged, making up 10-20% of total energy, with total fat intake limited to less than 35% of total energy. Additionally, 2-3 servings of oily fish per week and plant sources of n-3 fatty acids are recommended.

----
[PROTEIN INTAKE RECOMMENDATIONS]
For individuals with diabetes and no evidence of nephropathy, protein intake should be 10-20% of total energy. However, for those with early stages of chronic kidney disease, protein intake should be limited to 0.8-1 g/kg body weight/day.

----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION GUIDELINES]
Moderate alcohol use, up to 10 g/day for women and 20 g/day for men, is possible for individuals with diabetes. However, alcohol should be consumed with carbohydrate to avoid hypoglycemia, especially for those treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues.

----
[MACRONUTRIENT DISTRIBUTION FOR WEIGHT LOSS]
The optimal macronutrient distribution for weight loss diets has not been established, but low-fat diets have been traditionally promoted. Recently, low-carbohydrate, higher-fat diets have shown greater weight loss over short periods, but their long-term metabolic effects and safety regarding cardiovascular disease are unclear.
----
[CARBOHYDRATE INTAKE RECOMMENDATIONS]
The recommended carbohydrate intake for people with diabetes varies, but it is generally suggested to be around 45-60% of total energy intake. However, many people with diabetes tend to consume lower amounts of carbohydrates, with a mean intake of around 42% of total energy intake in some European countries. This is often due to fear of increasing blood sugar levels. Nutrition associations recommend that the general population consume around 50% of total energy intake as carbohydrate.

----
[DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and other organizations provide dietary guidelines for people with diabetes, including recommendations for energy balance, weight management, and nutrient intake. These guidelines advise reducing energy-dense foods high in saturated fat and free sugars, and monitoring lipid profiles, renal function, and protein intake when using low-carbohydrate diets for weight reduction.

----
[NUTRIENT INTAKE RECOMMENDATIONS]
Specific nutrient intake recommendations for people with diabetes include consuming 5 servings of fiber-rich vegetables or fruits and 4 servings of legumes per week, limiting total free sugars to 10% of total energy, and minimizing intake of trans-fats. Additionally, polyunsaturated fatty acids should not exceed 10% of total daily energy, and total fat intake should not exceed 35% of total energy.

----
[ALCOHOL AND MICRONUTRIENT INTAKE]
Alcohol intake should be limited in individuals with diabetes, particularly those who are overweight, hypertensive, or have hypertriglyceridemia, as well as during pregnancy and in advanced neuropathy. Moderate alcohol intake is recommended, defined as 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men. Foods rich in dietary antioxidants, trace elements, and other vitamins are encouraged, including daily consumption of a range of vegetables and fruits.
----
[LOW GI FOODS]
Low GI foods are favorable for people with diabetes, but only if other attributes of these foods are also in line with a healthy nutrition. Some foods with a low GI, such as chocolates, are high in fat and energy, making them less ideal. Special foods for people with diabetes that have reduced GI by replacing sucrose with sugar alcohols or fructose have not been proven to have substantial benefits. 
----
[DIETARY FIBER INTAKE]
People with diabetes often consume low amounts of dietary fiber, with an average intake of 8.0 g/1000 kcal or 19.5 g/day. Encouraging the consumption of fiber-containing foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and wholegrain products, can help with glycemic control, insulinemia, and serum lipid concentrations. Epidemiologic data has shown an inverse association between dietary fiber intake and HbA1c, as well as LDL cholesterol, and a positive association with HDL cholesterol.
----
[CARBOHYDRATE COUNTING]
The amount of carbohydrate is an essential factor for post-prandial glucose results in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Many individuals with diabetes use carbohydrate counting, carbohydrate exchanges, or experience-based estimation of carbohydrate intake to monitor their consumption. Different carbohydrates have different glycemic effects, and factors such as the nature of starch, dietary fiber, and type of sugar influence the glycemic response.
----
[GLYCEMIC INDEX]
The glycemic index (GI) describes the post-prandial blood glucose response of a carbohydrate-containing food compared to a reference food. Foods can be differentiated into high, average, or low GI foods, and using the GI or glycemic load of a food may confer moderate additional benefits for post-prandial glycemia and lipid profile. Substituting high GI foods with low GI foods, such as legumes, pasta, and wholegrain breads, can be beneficial for people with diabetes.
----
[DIETARY CARBOHYDRATE MANAGEMENT]
For people with diabetes treated with insulin or hypoglycemic agents, it's essential to match medication with carbohydrate intake to avoid hypoglycemia and excessive post-prandial hyperglycemia. Individuals on intensive insulin treatment should adjust their premeal insulin dose based on carbohydrate amount and type, considering the glycemic index (GI) of foods. Self-monitoring of blood glucose helps determine optimal food choices and timing. Adjusting insulin dosage or adding extra carbohydrates may be necessary before exercise.

----
[DIETARY FAT INTAKE]
The primary goal for dietary fat intake is to restrict consumption of saturated fatty acids, trans-fats, and increase dietary fiber, which is inversely related to cardiovascular disease and associated with lower BMI levels. The degree of evidence for recommended carbohydrate and dietary fiber intakes is shown in various tables. Restricting saturated fats and increasing fiber intake is crucial for people with diabetes.

----
[SUGAR INTAKE AND ALTERNATIVES]
Moderate intake of sucrose (less than 10% total energy) or other added sugars may be included in the diet of people with diabetes without worsening glycemic control. However, added fructose, sugar alcohols, or other nutritive sweeteners should not be encouraged due to potential adverse effects on serum triglycerides and uric acid levels. Approved non-nutritive sweeteners may be used, but their long-term benefits in metabolic control have not been proven.

----
[DIETARY FIBER INTAKE]
Dietary fiber intake is crucial for people with diabetes, with studies showing an inverse relationship between fiber intake and cardiovascular disease. The mean intake of dietary fiber varies across different regions, with some studies suggesting an average intake of 8-19.5 grams per day. Increasing dietary fiber intake is essential for people with diabetes to manage their condition effectively.
----
[DIETARY FATS AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Dietary fats play a crucial role in diabetes management, and individuals with diabetes should aim to minimize their intake of trans-fats and saturated fatty acids. Foods high in trans-fats, such as biscuits, cakes, and some hard margarines, can raise LDL cholesterol levels and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Instead, individuals with diabetes should focus on consuming unsaturated fatty acids, such as those found in rapeseed oil, soya bean oil, and nuts.
----
[RECOMMENDED FAT INTAKE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES]
The recommended intake of saturated fatty acids for individuals with diabetes is below 7% of total energy, but current data suggests that many individuals with type 1 diabetes are not meeting this target. On average, individuals with type 1 diabetes consume around 14% of their total energy from saturated fatty acids, which is twice the recommended amount. This highlights the need for fat modification to reduce the risk of vascular disease.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS]
Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to have cardioprotective effects and can help reduce serum triglycerides and improve platelet aggregation. Individuals with diabetes can benefit from consuming 2-3 servings of oily fish and plant sources of omega-3 fatty acids per week to support heart health.
----
[REDUCING SATURATED FATTY ACIDS]
Reducing saturated fatty acid intake can be achieved by replacing them with carbohydrate foods rich in fiber or unsaturated fatty acids, such as cis-monounsaturated fatty acids. This dietary approach has been shown to improve glycemia, insulin sensitivity, and serum lipid values in individuals with diabetes.
----
[DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS]
Dietary supplements, such as vitamins E, C, and carotene, are not recommended for routine supplementation due to concerns about long-term safety and lack of clear benefits. Diabetes associations do not offer recommendations regarding supplements or functional foods, as most promoted products have not been tested in long-term formal clinical trials. Vitamin or mineral supplementation in pharmacologic dosages should only be recommended in cases of proven deficiencies. Nutrition education is important for promoting healthy eating and meeting recommended intakes for people with diabetes.
----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION]
Alcohol consumption has both desirable and undesirable effects on people with diabetes, exhibiting a U-shaped relationship. Moderate alcohol intake (5-15 g/day) is associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, while excessive intake (>30-60 g/day) is linked to raised blood pressure. People with diabetes who choose to drink alcohol should limit their intake to no more than 10 g/day (1 drink) for females and 20 g/day (2 drinks) for males.
----
[ALCOHOL AND BLOOD GLUCOSE]
Consuming alcohol with carbohydrate-containing food does not have acute effects on blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. However, there is a potential risk of alcohol-induced hypoglycemia, particularly in those treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and consuming carbohydrate when alcohol is taken is recommended. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with the quantity of alcohol consumed and may last into the following day.
----
[DIETARY PROTEIN]
For individuals with diabetes and normal renal function, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that usual protein intake should be modified. However, high protein intake above 20% of total energy may have unknown effects on renal function, and while it may produce short-term weight loss and improved glycemia, long-term benefits are unclear.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Managing diabetes requires a comprehensive approach that includes nutritional training, physical activity, and monitoring of blood glucose levels. Individuals with diabetes should work with their care team to develop a personalized plan that balances metabolic control, risk factor management, and overall well-being. This plan should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the individual's therapeutic needs. 

----
[NUTRITIONAL TRAINING]
Nutritional training is a crucial component of diabetes management, and it should be based on the latest scientific evidence. The goal of nutritional training is to help individuals with diabetes achieve their treatment goals while maintaining the pleasure of eating and drinking. A knowledgeable diabetes care team should work with the individual to develop a personalized nutrition plan that takes into account their unique needs and circumstances.

----
[DIETARY MANAGEMENT]
Dietary management is a critical aspect of diabetes care, and it should be tailored to the individual's specific needs and health goals. The outcome of dietary management should be evaluated using important markers such as HbA1c, blood pressure, and serum lipids. Regular monitoring and documentation of dietary management are essential to ensure that the individual is meeting their health goals.

----
[DIET IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES]
Dietary recommendations for individuals with diabetes may vary depending on their specific circumstances, such as pregnancy or childhood. For example, women with diabetes who are pregnant should aim to achieve blood glucose concentrations as close to normal as possible without inducing hypoglycemia. They should also receive detailed dietary counseling to ensure that they are meeting their nutritional needs and avoiding complications.

----
[DIETARY COUNSELING DURING PREGNANCY]
Women with diabetes who are pregnant should receive individualized dietary counseling to ensure that they are meeting their nutritional needs and avoiding complications. The goal of dietary counseling during pregnancy is to achieve recommended blood glucose values and provide adequate energy and nutrient intake for fetal growth and development. Additional calorie intake may be necessary, but total daily energy should not be under 1600 kcal/day.
----
[DIET AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Lifestyle modification, including diet and weight management, plays a crucial role in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association, the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, and the American Society for Clinical Nutrition recommend weight management through lifestyle modification for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. A combination of diet and physical activity can help improve blood glucose control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT]
Nutritional management is essential for patients with diabetes, and recommendations for dietary intake have been established by the Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. A healthy diet that is low in fat and high in fiber can help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, studies have shown that low-carbohydrate diets can be effective for weight loss and improving cardiovascular risk factors.

----
[EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT DIETS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Research has shown that different diets, including low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets, can be effective for weight loss and improving blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of specific diets is limited, and more research is needed to determine the best dietary approach for managing type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that low-carbohydrate diets were more effective for weight loss than low-fat diets.

----
[ROLE OF WEIGHT LOSS IN DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Weight loss is an important aspect of diabetes management, and studies have shown that even modest weight loss can improve blood glucose control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The Look AHEAD study, a clinical trial of weight loss for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes, found that intensive lifestyle intervention, including diet and physical activity, can lead to significant weight loss and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors.
----
[DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
A low-glycemic index diet has been shown to improve plasma glucose control, whole-body glucose utilization, and lipid profile in type 2 diabetic patients. Additionally, increased fiber intake has been linked to improved blood glucose control and reduced hypoglycemic events in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A diet rich in fiber and low in glycemic index can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF FIBER INTAKE IN DIABETES]
High dietary fiber intake has been found to have beneficial effects on patients with type 2 diabetes, including improved glycemic control and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Studies have also shown that fiber intake is inversely related to HbA1c levels and the prevalence of severe ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes.

----
[LOW-GLYCEMIC INDEX DIETS AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Low-glycemic index diets have been shown to improve glycemic control and lipid profiles in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Flexible low-glycemic index dietary advice has also been found to be effective in achieving glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has confirmed the benefits of low-glycemic index diets in diabetes management.

----
[NUTRITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DIABETES PREVENTION AND TREATMENT]
Evidence-based nutritional recommendations for the treatment and prevention of diabetes emphasize the importance of a balanced diet that includes foods with a low glycemic index and high fiber content. A European perspective on nutritional recommendations for diabetes highlights the need for individualized dietary advice and ongoing nutrition education for patients with diabetes.

----
[INSULIN MANAGEMENT AND DIETARY FREEDOM]
Flexible, intensive insulin management can enable dietary freedom in people with type 1 diabetes, allowing for more flexibility in carbohydrate intake and meal planning. Studies have shown that training in flexible insulin management can improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemic events in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
----
[DIET AND BLOOD PRESSURE]
Research studies have shown that moderate sodium restriction and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet can help lower blood pressure in hypertensive type II diabetics. These dietary changes can have a positive impact on blood pressure management in individuals with diabetes. The DASH-Sodium Collaborative Research Group found that reduced dietary sodium and the DASH diet can help reduce blood pressure. 

----
[ANTIOXIDANT VITAMINS AND DIABETES]
Antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamin E, have been studied for their potential influence on diabetes mellitus. Some studies have found that vitamin E may have a positive effect on cardiovascular and microvascular outcomes in high-risk patients with diabetes. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between antioxidant vitamins and diabetes management.

----
[HERBS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS]
A systematic review of herbs and dietary supplements for glycemic control in diabetes found that some supplements may have a positive effect on blood sugar management. However, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these supplements for diabetes management.

----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND DIABETES]
Alcohol consumption can have both positive and negative effects on diabetes management. Some studies have found that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, excessive alcohol consumption can have negative effects on glucose control and increase the risk of microvascular complications.

----
[NUTRITION EDUCATION AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Nutrition education has been shown to improve metabolic outcomes in older adults with diabetes mellitus. A randomized controlled trial found that nutrition education can help improve glucose control and reduce the risk of complications in older adults with diabetes. This highlights the importance of nutrition education in diabetes management.
----
[EXERCISE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY]
Regular exercise increases insulin sensitivity in both individuals with and without diabetes. In individuals without diabetes, plasma insulin levels decrease during low to moderate intensity exercise to compensate for increases in insulin sensitivity. This helps maintain blood glucose homeostasis. 
----
[EXERCISE EFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE]
In individuals with type 1 diabetes, low to moderate intensity exercise can result in hypoglycemia, as insulin levels cannot be regulated physiologically. On the other hand, high intensity exercise can cause hyperglycemia in individuals with and without diabetes, with more marked and prolonged effects in those with type 1 diabetes.
----
[EXERCISE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Individuals with type 1 diabetes are recommended to adjust their insulin dose and carbohydrate consumption prior to, during, and/or after exercise to accommodate the type, intensity, and duration of exercise performed. While regular exercise may not improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes, it is associated with decreased long-term morbidity and mortality.
----
[EXERCISE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES PREVENTION]
Structured supervised diet and exercise interventions can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus by about 60% in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. Regular exercise also improves glycemic control significantly in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
----
[EXERCISE AND MORTALITY RISK]
Individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who have moderate or high aerobic fitness have long-term mortality that is 50-60% lower than those with low cardiorespiratory fitness. Combined aerobic and resistance exercise is more effective than either type alone in maximizing the impact of lifestyle measures on glycemic control.
----
[RESISTANCE TRAINING FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Resistance training is a safe and effective means of improving glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes of all ages, and can be used in combination with aerobic exercise for optimal results.
----
[EXERCISE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY]
Regular exercise training can improve insulin sensitivity in previously untrained individuals. Lipid and lipoprotein profiles become less atherogenic with regular training, with increases in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and potential declines in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. This can lead to a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
----
[ANAEROBIC EXERCISE EFFECTS]
Regular anaerobic training improves the body's ability to provide the necessary fuels for anaerobic power production, increasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine levels within muscle tissue. This allows individuals to sustain higher exercise intensities for longer periods. Anaerobic exercise also increases the body's ability to tolerate acid-base imbalance during high-intensity exercise.
----
[EXERCISE AND BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS]
Very intense exercise can lead to a 5- to 10-fold increase in blood glucose levels due to hepatic glucose production exceeding glucose utilization. During recovery, hyperglycemia often occurs, followed by an increase in plasma insulin levels and a return to baseline glucose levels within about 45 minutes. Prolonged moderate-intensity aerobic exercise without caloric intake can eventually lead to hypoglycemia.
----
[EXERCISE AND FUEL METABOLISM]
Aerobically trained athletes without diabetes have low fasting plasma insulin levels, reduced insulin responses to glucose challenges, and increased insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Regular training can also increase muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity, leading to improved glucose metabolism. Physical training can have a positive impact on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.
----
[PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Physical activity has been shown to have an inverse association with the severity of several complications in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Studies have found that individuals with T1DM who engage in regular physical activity tend to have better glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. Additionally, physical activity has been found to reduce the risk of impaired renal function, proteinuria, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease in individuals with T1DM.
----
[RESISTANCE EXERCISE AND MUSCLE STRENGTH]
Regular heavy resistance training can increase muscle strength by over 30% and gain muscle mass ranging from 3 to 12% within the first couple of months of training. Resistance training can also improve postural stability and dynamic balance, reducing the risk of fall-related injuries in older adults. Initial strength gains are generally due to peripheral nervous system adaptations, and muscle hypertrophy typically occurs later.
----
[RESISTANCE EXERCISE AND FUEL METABOLISM]
High intensity, short duration resistance exercise is fueled by energy generated from the breakdown of stored intramuscular high-energy phosphates. As intensity decreases and the number of repetitions per set increases, glycolytic anaerobic energy production becomes more important, leading to local muscle lactate accumulation and declines in muscle glycogen. Adequate rest periods between sets are necessary to allow regeneration of phosphocreatine stores.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF EXERCISE FOR DIABETES PREVENTION]
Regular exercise has been shown to prevent and delay the progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy over a 4-year period. Exercise can also improve glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and reduce the risk of various complications associated with diabetes, making it an essential component of diabetes management.
----
[EXERCISE AND BLOOD GLUCOSE RESPONSE]
Exercise can affect blood glucose concentrations in individuals with diabetes, causing them to decline, increase, or remain unchanged. The response to exercise is influenced by factors such as the timing of the previous insulin injection and meal, as well as the intensity and duration of the exercise. In individuals with type 1 diabetes, insulin secretion cannot decline during moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, leading to hyperinsulinemia and potentially causing hypoglycemia.
----
[HYPERINSULINEMIA AND EXERCISE]
Hyperinsulinemia can occur during exercise due to various reasons, including the peak action of previously injected insulin, accelerated insulin absorption from the exercised limb, or the use of intermediate or long-acting insulin. This can lead to hypoglycemia, unless the insulin dose is adjusted or extra carbohydrates are consumed. Hyperinsulinemia can also prevent the normal increase in lipid mobilization during exercise, reducing the availability of non-esterified fatty acids as a fuel.
----
[HYPOINSULINEMIA AND EXERCISE]
Conversely, if insulin levels are too low during exercise, the inhibitory effect of insulin on hepatic glucose production and its stimulatory effect on glucose uptake are both reduced. This can lead to hyperglycemia, as the counter-regulatory response to exercise is higher than normal under conditions of insulin deficiency. The overall result is markedly increased hepatic glucose production and diminished glucose utilization by the exercising muscle.
----
[FACTORS DETERMINING GLYCEMIC RESPONSE TO EXERCISE]
The glycemic response to acute exercise in people with type 1 diabetes is determined by several factors, including the presence of hyperinsulinemia or hypoinsulinemia, the intensity and duration of the exercise, and the consumption of snacks before or during exercise. Blood glucose tends to decrease with hyperinsulinemia and prolonged exercise, remain unchanged with brief and mild to moderate exercise, and increase with hypoinsulinemia and very intense exercise.
----
[GLUCOREGULATION IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
In individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM), the glucagon:insulin molar ratio at the portal vein may not reach the level necessary for adequate hepatic glucose production, leading to a lower reliance on hepatic glycogen stores during low-intensity aerobic activity. This can increase the potential for hypoglycemia if the rate of glucose appearance in the system is not high enough to supply the demand. Hyperinsulinemia can lead to a greater reliance on exogenous glucose utilization during moderate aerobic exercise, without sparing glycogen stores.

----
[EXERCISE AND FUEL METABOLISM IN T1DM]
Individuals with T1DM seem to have a greater reliance on muscle glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to produce fuel during physical activity than their non-diabetic counterparts. During exercise, the contribution of carbohydrates to overall energy metabolism is greater in hyperglycemia than in euglycemia, accompanied by a blunted cortisol and growth hormone response. After prolonged exercise, patients may be prone to hypoglycemia for many hours due to persistently enhanced glucose uptake by the exercised muscles.

----
[POST-EXERCISE HYPOGLYCEMIA IN T1DM]
After certain types of prolonged exercise, such as a marathon run, increased lipid oxidation can persist, reducing the use of glucose as a fuel and insulin sensitivity, thereby decreasing the risk of post-exercise hypoglycemia. However, individuals who experience frequent bouts of hypoglycemia may have further blunting of counter-regulatory responses to exercise, potentially creating a vicious cycle of hypoglycemic events.

----
[ANAEROBIC EXERCISE TRAINING IN T1DM]
There is currently a gap in the literature on how physical and metabolic adaptations to regular anaerobic training in individuals with T1DM differ from those of non-diabetic individuals. People with T1DM who participate in competitive sports may find that their glycemic control worsens due to an irregular schedule of very vigorous exercise, insulin dose reduction, and high carbohydrate consumption.

----
[INSULIN CONCENTRATIONS DURING EXERCISE]
Insulin concentrations during exercise depend on the type of insulin and the time interval between the injection and exercise, with serum insulin concentrations during early exercise being higher after injection of the lispro (Humalog) insulin analog than after conventional soluble insulin.
----
[RESISTANCE EXERCISE IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Resistance exercise training has been shown to have positive effects on individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), including lower HbA1c levels, serum cholesterol, and self-monitored glucose levels. A study found that 10 weeks of heavy resistance exercise training three times a week resulted in a significant decrease in HbA1c levels from 6.9% to 5.8%. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the effects of resistance exercise on T1DM management.
----
[COMPARISON OF RESISTANCE AND AEROBIC TRAINING]
A study compared the effects of 12 weeks of resistance training with those of a comparable period of aerobic training in individuals with T1DM. While both groups showed improvements in waist circumference and insulin dosage, the aerobic training group had a significant increase in HbA1c levels, whereas the resistance training group had a non-significant decrease. This suggests that resistance training may be a more effective form of exercise for improving glycemic control in T1DM.
----
[COMBINED AEROBIC AND RESISTANCE TRAINING]
Combined aerobic and resistance training programs have been shown to have positive effects on individuals with T1DM, including lower HbA1c levels, decreased blood pressure, improved nerve conduction, and higher cardiorespiratory fitness. These studies suggest that a combination of both types of exercise may be beneficial for overall health and glycemic control in T1DM.
----
[EXERCISE AND HYPERGLYCEMIA]
High-intensity exercise can cause hyperglycemia in individuals with T1DM, even in the presence of normal or high insulin levels. This is due to the stimulation of glucose production beyond the limits of peripheral utilization, as well as the inability of the body to double insulin concentration after intense exercise. As a result, individuals with T1DM may experience prolonged hyperglycemia and increased blood ketone-body concentrations after high-intensity exercise.
----
[PREVENTING HYPOGLYCEMIA WITH HIGH-INTENSITY EXERCISE]
Recent studies have shown that high-intensity exercise can be effective in increasing blood glucose levels and delaying or preventing hypoglycemia related to moderate exercise. Short bouts of high-intensity exercise, such as 10-second sprints, have been shown to significantly attenuate post-exercise drops in blood glucose levels. This suggests that incorporating high-intensity exercise into a workout routine may be a useful strategy for preventing hypoglycemia in individuals with T1DM.
----
[RESISTANCE EXERCISE AND TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Resistance exercise has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Studies have demonstrated that resistance training alone or in combination with aerobic exercise can lead to significant reductions in HbA1c levels. For example, a study by Durak et al. found that 10 weeks of resistance training resulted in a decrease in HbA1c from 6.9% to 5.8%. 
----
[COMBINED AEROBIC AND RESISTANCE TRAINING]
Combined aerobic and resistance training has also been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control in individuals with T1DM. A study by Mosher et al. found that 12 weeks of combined aerobic and resistance training resulted in a decrease in HbA1c from 7.72% to 6.76%. The training program consisted of 3 sessions per week, with each session including 5 aerobic stations followed by 5 strength and callisthenic exercises.
----
[COMPARISON OF AEROBIC AND RESISTANCE TRAINING]
A study by Ramalho et al. compared the effects of aerobic training and resistance training on glycemic control in individuals with T1DM. The results showed that resistance training was more effective in improving glycemic control, with a decrease in HbA1c from 8.2% to 7.6%, compared to an increase from 8.7% to 9.8% in the aerobic training group.
----
[FUEL SELECTION DURING RESISTANCE EXERCISE]
Little is known about the acute hormonal and resulting blood glucose responses to resistance exercise in individuals with T1DM. However, it is likely that resistance-type activities are associated with increases in blood glucose during and after exercise, due to elevated epinephrine levels and enhanced hepatic glucose production. Further research is needed to examine the glycemic response during and after resistance exercise in individuals with T1DM.
----
[DIABETES PREVENTION THROUGH WEIGHT LOSS]
A 16% reduction in diabetes risk was observed for every kilogram of weight loss among lifestyle intervention participants, after adjusting for changes in diet and physical activity. Increased physical activity was a significant predictor of weight loss and played a crucial role in weight maintenance. Participants who met the goal of more than 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week had a 46% reduction in diabetes risk.

[EXERCISE AND INSULIN DOSAGE]
During exercise, insulin dosage may need to be slightly increased or the injection schedule changed to achieve higher plasma insulin concentrations. Using an insulin pump can be advantageous for physically active individuals, as it allows for easier adjustments to accommodate meals, snacks, and exercise. This can help decrease the variability of glucose absorption and lower the risk of hypoglycemia.
----
[EXERCISE AND HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK]
In individuals with type 2 diabetes, exercise does not usually cause hypoglycemia, and it can be a valuable tool to improve glycemic control and assist with weight maintenance. However, if blood glucose declines rapidly during exercise, the dosage of the drug should be reduced or the drug withheld on exercising days. Carbohydrate supplementation is usually unnecessary with exercise, but may be needed if pre-exercise blood glucose levels are low.
----
[CARBONYDRATE SUPPLEMENTATION DURING EXERCISE]
A reasonable starting point for carbohydrate supplementation during exercise is to take approximately 15g of carbohydrate before and 15-40g at 30-60 minute intervals during longer exercise sessions. The amount of carbohydrate consumed should be adjusted according to blood glucose monitoring results, and some individuals may not require any carbohydrate supplementation. During strenuous exercise, at least part of the carbohydrate can be taken as a sucrose-containing beverage.
----
[METHODS OF CARBONYDRATE SUPPLEMENTATION]
There are several methods of carbohydrate supplementation, including a basic approach, semi-quantitative approach, and quantitative method. The goal is to consume a quantity of oral carbohydrate that matches the amount of glucose being used by the working muscles during activity. However, only a finite amount of carbohydrate (40-60g/hour) can be absorbed while the body is moderately or vigorously active, requiring some carbohydrate to be consumed prior to exercise or during recovery.
----
[EXERCISE AND GLUCOSE MONITORING]
Regular glucose monitoring is still recommended, especially during and after exercise, to adjust carbohydrate supplementation and insulin dosage as needed. This can help prevent hypoglycemia and ensure optimal glucose control during physical activity.

In many countries, drivers with diabetes are legally required to declare their diagnosis for their driving license and motor insurance.

----
[EMPLOYMENT AND DIABETES]
Diabetes is not a bar to most occupations, and people with diabetes are protected in many countries by legislation against discrimination on the grounds of disability. However, people with insulin-treated diabetes are barred from certain occupations, such as the armed forces, emergency services, and commercial pilots, due to the risk of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia in the workplace is uncommon, but depressive illness and poor glycemic control are associated with higher unemployment and sickness absence in people with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES IN PRISON AND CUSTODY]
Glycemic control may be suboptimal in prison due to restrictions in diet, exercise, and blood glucose monitoring. Input from a diabetes specialist may improve the quality of care, and knowledge of diabetes among prison officers and staff is often limited and may be improved by liaising with local diabetes specialist services. Intercurrent illness and metabolic abnormalities may not be recognized or treated promptly in prison settings.

----
[INSURANCE AND DIABETES]
Diabetes should be declared to insurers, who may impose higher premiums or limited coverage. Many insurers' decisions are based on outdated actuarial data or misconceptions about the current prognosis of diabetes. National diabetes organizations can provide details of insurance brokers who do not weight policies against people with diabetes, and life insurance premiums should be reduced for those who reach the age of 50 years without renal impairment.

----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND DIABETES]
Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and can compromise control of established diabetes. However, moderate alcohol intake has been shown to have a U-shaped relationship with diabetes, with moderate intake being associated with a lower risk of diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis and secondary diabetes are also associated with excessive alcohol consumption.
----
[DRIVING RESTRICTIONS FOR DIABETES PATIENTS]
Newly diagnosed people with diabetes, especially those treated with insulin, should not drive until their glycemic control and vision are stable. Recurrent daytime hypoglycemia, impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, reduced visual acuity, and severe sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy are also reasons for drivers with diabetes to cease driving.

The frequency of hypoglycemia-related accidents is substantially lower than those caused by alcohol and drugs.

----
[PREVENTING HYPOGLYCEMIA WHILE DRIVING]
General measures to avoid hypoglycemia while driving include keeping fast-acting carbohydrate in the vehicle, planning car journeys in advance, and checking blood glucose before and during long journeys. It is also advisable to take frequent rest and meals, and to take prophylactic carbohydrate if the blood glucose is < 5.0 mmol/L. Driving should not be resumed for at least 45 minutes after blood glucose has returned to normal.

----
[MANAGING HYPOGLYCEMIA WHILE DRIVING]
If hypoglycemia occurs during driving, the car should be stopped in a safe place, and the engine switched off before consuming some glucose. Drivers with insulin-treated diabetes should carry a card or identity bracelet stating the diagnosis, and individuals with newly diagnosed insulin-treated diabetes may have to stop driving temporarily until their glycemic control is stable.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION]
Hypoglycemia can cause cognitive dysfunction, even during relatively mild hypoglycemia that does not induce symptoms. Studies have shown that driving performance often becomes impaired at blood glucose concentrations of 3.4 – 3.8 mmol/L, and deteriorates further at lower levels. Problems included poor road positioning, driving too fast, and inappropriate braking.

----
[ORAL ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Sulfonylureas are the only group of oral antidiabetic drugs that may cause hypoglycemia while driving, and people treated with these agents should be informed of this possibility. GLP-1 agonists alone are not associated with a risk of hypoglycemia, but this may be a problem when used in combination with a sulfonylurea. Blood glucose testing in relation to driving may be required for holders of group 2 licenses who are taking this treatment combination.
----
[DIABETES AND DRIVING]
Eye screening is a crucial part of assessing medical fitness to drive for individuals with diabetes. Patients should be told not to drive for at least 2 hours after the use of mydriatics, which temporarily reduces visual acuity. The driving regulatory authority may request perimetry to assess visual fields. This is especially important for individuals with diabetes who may be at risk of visual field loss due to retinal ischemia or laser photocoagulation.

----
[STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR DRIVERS WITH DIABETES]
In most developed countries, drivers with diabetes are required by law to declare their diabetes to the relevant regulatory authority.

Drivers with diabetes must comply with these requirements to ensure their safety on the road.

----
[EUROPEAN DRIVING LICENSES AND VISUAL ACUITY]
In the European Union, drivers must be able to read a number plate with letters 8.9 cm high at a distance of 30 m, wearing spectacles if necessary, to meet the minimum visual acuity requirement. However, this test has limitations, as it does not assess visual fields, night vision, or the ability to see moving objects, which may be severely reduced by diabetic retinopathy. Drivers with diabetes should be aware of these potential visual limitations and take necessary precautions.

----
[VISUAL FIELD LOSS AND DRIVING]
Visual field loss can be caused by extensive laser photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, or cataracts, which can affect an individual's ability to drive safely. Drivers with diabetes who experience worsening vision should report it to the licensing authority, and may need to undergo further assessment to determine their fitness to drive. In some cases, visual field loss may result in a driver's license being refused or revoked.
----
[DRIVING REGULATIONS FOR DIABETES PATIENTS]
In the UK, insulin-treated drivers with diabetes who apply for a Group 2 license are subject to modified medical fitness criteria. Oral antidiabetic medication is not a bar to vocational driving licenses, but progression to insulin therapy may terminate employment as a bus or train driver. Taxi and ambulance drivers are not covered by statutory regulations, and local authorities issue taxi licenses with varying assessment standards.
----
[EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS FOR DIABETES PATIENTS]
People with diabetes can successfully undertake a wide range of employment, but some restrictions apply, particularly for vocational driving licenses. Insulin-treated diabetes may limit employment opportunities, such as driving commercial motor vehicles across state borders in the USA. However, many low and middle-income countries impose no restrictions on vocational driving licenses for people with insulin-treated diabetes.
----
[AVIATION REGULATIONS FOR DIABETES PATIENTS]
The UK Civil Aviation Authority does not allow individuals with diabetes treated with insulin or sulfonylureas to fly commercial aircraft or work as air traffic controllers. Private pilot licenses can be issued to individuals with diabetes taking sulfonylureas, but not insulin. The EU has discussed introducing common airworthiness regulations for pilots with medical disorders.
----
[NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR DIABETES PATIENTS]
In the UK, individuals with diabetes must inform the DVLA when applying for a driving license or if diabetes develops subsequently. Failure to do so can result in a fine and invalidate a claim to motor insurers. Doctors providing diabetic care have a responsibility to inform patients of this legal requirement and offer practical advice.
----
[EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS AND DIABETES]
Employers should not have blanket policies that disbar workers with diabetes from specific occupations, as individual assessment is crucial. Employment regulations may not differentiate between different types and treatments of diabetes, and some bureaucratic regulations have been successfully challenged on medical grounds. This highlights the importance of considering each individual's unique situation and medical condition when making employment decisions.

----
[DISCRIMINATION AND EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS]
Discrimination by employers may affect hiring practices, with job applicants who disclose their diabetes being more likely to be refused than non-diabetic individuals. However, legislation in many countries, including the UK, has improved employment prospects for people with diabetes by making it unlawful to treat a disabled person less favorably. Employers' concerns about diabetes often center around the risk to safety associated with the condition or its treatment.

----
[DIABETES-RELATED RISKS AND EMPLOYMENT]
The main concerns when considering people with diabetes for employment are the risks of acute hypoglycemia related to insulin and sulfonylureas, poor control of diabetes, and the development of serious diabetic complications. Employment is generally restricted where hypoglycemia could be hazardous to the worker with diabetes, their colleagues, or the general public. These risks are not limited to people with Type 1 diabetes, as the rising prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in the working-age population and increasing use of insulin have become issues for occupational health assessment.

----
[IMPACT OF DIABETES ON EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY]
Diabetes can affect employment through increased sick leave and absenteeism, and by adversely influencing productivity. The condition can also have a negative long-term influence on the economic productivity of the individual, with health-related disabilities causing work limitations, especially in older employees. Additionally, diabetes can lead to early retirement on medical grounds, highlighting the need for supportive employment practices and accommodations to help individuals with diabetes maintain their employment and productivity.
----
[DIABETES AND INSURANCE]
People with diabetes may face challenges when seeking insurance due to the associated risks of complications and reduced life expectancy. Insurance companies consider factors such as the severity and duration of diabetes, extent of complications, and other concurrent medical disorders when determining premiums and coverage. However, there is wide variation in insurance terms and premiums among different countries and companies, suggesting that decisions are often based on assumptions rather than scientific evidence.

----
[INSURANCE UNDERWRITING FOR DIABETES]
Insurance underwriting for individuals with diabetes can be discriminatory, with some companies basing decisions on outdated information or considering only the presence of Type 1 diabetes. There are no standardized guidelines for insurance underwriting for diabetes, and companies may have different approaches to risk classification and premium determination. Individuals with diabetes seeking insurance should request quotations from multiple companies and be supported by a medical assessment from a competent physician.

----
[PROGNOSIS AND LIFE INSURANCE FOR DIABETES]
The prognosis for people with diabetes, particularly Type 1 diabetes, has improved significantly over the last 50 years, with a median life expectancy increase of over 15 years. This improvement has led to suggestions that life insurance for individuals with Type 1 diabetes should focus on the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy, and a model has been proposed to calculate insurance terms based on current age, age at diagnosis, and other factors. Some insurance companies have adopted this approach, reducing premiums for individuals who reach a certain age without developing nephropathy.

----
[EMPLOYMENT AND DIABETES]
Studies have reported varying results on the impact of diabetes on employment, with some finding no excess unemployment among people with diabetes compared to the general population, while others have found that individuals with diabetes are more likely to experience unemployment or difficulties with work performance. Depressive illness is strongly associated with unemployment and work difficulties, and adolescents with diabetes may be more likely to lose jobs or fail to follow their desired career paths.
----
[ALCOHOL AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Alcohol consumption can affect glucose control in individuals with diabetes, as it suppresses gluconeogenesis and inhibits glucose recovery, potentially leading to hypoglycemia. In people with diabetes, alcohol consumption may impede recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and the signs of hypoglycemia may be missed or mistaken for those of alcohol intoxication. Moderate alcohol consumption can increase cognitive impairment during hypoglycemia, and individuals with insulin-treated diabetes should be advised not to drink alcohol before driving.

----
[ALCOHOL-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Alcohol is a significant contributory factor to episodes of hypoglycemia in people with diabetes, with an estimated 20% of episodes attributed to alcohol consumption. Hypoglycemia-induced brain damage is rare but can occur after excessive alcohol consumption, and severe hypoglycemia caused by binge drinking has led to permanent neurologic damage and even death in some cases.

----
[DIABETES AND INSURANCE]
People with diabetes may face higher premiums for accident insurance, despite no evidence of increased accidents or permanent disability. There is also no rationale for higher motor insurance premiums, particularly for those not treated with insulin. It is essential for individuals with diabetes to disclose their diagnosis to their insurer, as concealing it can nullify the contract and the insurer's liability.

----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND DIABETES RISK]
Moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and improve metabolic control, but chronic excessive consumption can be deleterious to long-term diabetes management and general health. Chronic high consumption of alcohol can also predispose to the development of secondary diabetes due to its direct toxic effect on the pancreas.
----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Moderate alcohol consumption in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is not associated with poorer glycemic control, and some studies have found a linear inverse relationship between alcohol consumption and glycemic control. However, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to central obesity, which may negatively impact glycemic control. Additionally, alcohol provides a significant amount of calories, particularly in the form of beer and lager, which can hinder weight loss efforts in obese individuals with T2DM.
----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
Moderate alcohol consumption in people with T2DM is associated with a 35% reduction in total mortality compared to non-drinkers. High alcohol consumption (more than 18g/day) is not associated with excess mortality, and may even lower the risk of cardiovascular mortality and incident coronary heart disease. However, heavy drinking can lead to poorer compliance with medications, outpatient follow-up, and self-blood glucose monitoring.
----
[ALCOHOL CALORIE CONTENT AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Alcohol provides 7 kcal of energy per gram, which can contribute to a substantial caloric intake, particularly in the form of beer and lager. This can be a commonly overlooked source of calories in obese, middle-aged males with T2DM who are trying to lose weight. Low-carbohydrate beers and lagers should not be recommended due to their high alcohol content, and spirits with sugar-rich mixers can also contribute to excessive calorie intake.
----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND DIABETES]
Moderate alcohol consumption (30-70 g/week) is associated with a reduced risk of microvascular complications, such as proliferative retinopathy and neuropathy, in individuals with type 1 diabetes. However, excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, and erectile dysfunction. Diabetes UK recommends that women with diabetes drink no more than 2 units of alcohol per day and men no more than 3 units. These limits are broadly similar to guidelines issued by comparable organizations in other countries.
----
[RECREATIONAL DRUG USE AND DIABETES]
The use of recreational drugs, such as cannabis, amfetamine-type stimulants, cocaine, and opiates, can pose particular difficulties for people with diabetes. These substances can have harmful effects on individuals with diabetes, and their use is a serious problem in the general population. The main classes of drugs involved are regulated under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971, which grades drugs according to harm associated with misuse and specifies controls over manufacture, supply, and possession.
----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION GUIDELINES FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES]
General advice for people with diabetes regarding alcohol consumption includes drinking moderate amounts of alcohol with meals, never drinking on an empty stomach, and not substituting alcoholic drinks for usual meals or snacks. Additionally, individuals with diabetes should be aware of the risks of hypoglycemia, particularly when consuming large quantities of alcohol, and should wear some form of diabetes identification when drinking. It is also important to note that all types of alcoholic drinks contain calories and may contribute to weight gain or failed dietary efforts.
----
[REGULATION OF RECREATIONAL DRUGS]
In the UK, drugs associated with dependence or misuse are regulated under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971, which grades drugs according to harm associated with misuse and specifies controls over manufacture, supply, and possession. The Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 2001 define the classes of individuals who are authorized to supply and possess controlled drugs and lay down the conditions under which these activities may be carried out. Drugs are classified under five schedules, which specify the requirements governing import, export, production, supply, possession, prescribing, and record keeping.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS]
Intravenous drug abusers with diabetes often face challenges in managing their condition, including omission of insulin therapy, frequent hospital admissions, and high mortality rates due to diabetic ketoacidosis and accidental overdose. They may also experience complications related to injection sites, such as deep venous thrombosis and abscesses. Maintaining contact with these individuals can be difficult due to defaulting from outpatient clinic attendance and imprisonment.
----
[Effects OF COCAINE AND AMPHETAMINES ON DIABETES]
Cocaine and amphetamines can have dramatic effects on the cardiovascular system, leading to tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and hypertension, which can antagonize the action of insulin and increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Prolonged use can result in dilated cardiomyopathy, and cocaine use has been identified as an independent risk factor for diabetic ketoacidosis. The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased by omitting insulin to avoid hypoglycemia.
----
[EFFECTS OF ECSTASY ON DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Ecstasy is associated with severe hyponatremia due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which can complicate the management of diabetic ketoacidosis. Additionally, ecstasy use can lead to frenetic behavior, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia in people treated with insulin.
----
[EFFECTS OF CANNABIS ON DIABETES]
Cannabis is not known to affect glucose metabolism directly, but its effects on the central nervous system may increase appetite and impair recognition of hypoglycemia. While cannabis use is generally well-tolerated in the absence of structural heart disease, it can lead to sympathetic activation and tachycardia at low doses, and parasympathetic activation and bradycardia at high doses.
----
[PREVALENCE OF RECREATIONAL DRUG USE]
Approximately 5% of adults worldwide use recreational drugs at least annually, and 2.6% use them at least monthly. In the UK, drug abuse is more common in men and people under 25 years old, with about one-third of adults having used recreational drugs at least once in their lifetime and 10% in the previous year. Trends in recreational drug use have changed in recent years, with a decline in LSD and solvent use and an increase in amphetamine-type drugs and ketamine.
----
[INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR DIABETES]
Comprehensive medical insurance is essential for individuals with diabetes to cover accidents, illnesses, and loss of medical equipment and drugs. The insurance policy must cover diabetes and other pre-existing medical conditions to avoid claim rejections. Travel policies often contain exclusions, including diabetes, which may not cover conditions like stroke or myocardial infarction. It is crucial to have adequate insurance coverage, especially for dangerous sporting activities or emergency air transport.

----
[TRAVEL MEDICAL CARE FOR DIABETES]
In the EU, emergency medical attention is often provided free or at reduced rates to visitors from other member states, but immediate payment may be required in some countries. Travelers can obtain a form (E111) to confirm their entitlement to this scheme, and those planning to stay in an EU country for over 6 months will require an E112 form. Some non-EU countries also offer free or reduced-rate medical care for EU members.

----
[DIABETES-RELATED EMERGENCY CARE ABROAD]
Emergency medical care available in some countries may be suboptimal or even potentially dangerous for diabetes-related emergencies, with limited access to insulin and intravenous fluids. This should be considered when choosing a holiday destination, and individuals with diabetes should research the medical care available at their destination.

----
[ESSENTIAL ITEMS FOR DIABETIC TRAVELERS]
Essential items for diabetic travelers include immunization, medication, and blood monitoring equipment. Air travelers treated with insulin should carry an ample supply in their hand luggage, and medication and equipment should not be consigned to the hold. Insulin can be carried in an insulated cool bag or a pre-cooled vacuum flask, and individuals on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) should carry insulin pens as a backup.

----
[RECREATIONAL DRUG USE AND DIABETES]
Recreational drugs can cause significant morbidity and are hazardous for people with diabetes, impairing the ability to recognize and treat hypoglycemia. The sympathomimetic effects of certain stimulants may mimic the autonomic signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Advice on recreational drug use should be given in a sensitive and non-judgmental manner, emphasizing the importance of modest reductions in insulin dosage and regular consumption of carbohydrate-based snacks or non-alcoholic sugary drinks.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT DURING AIR TRAVEL]
For people with diabetes, especially those with type 2 diabetes, it's essential to manage carbohydrate intake during air travel to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. Vegetarian meals may be more suitable for individuals with type 1 diabetes. It's also crucial to consider delayed flights, long intervals between meals, and the potential for fatigue or travel sickness to affect appetite. 

----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION DURING AIR TRAVEL]
Drinking alcohol before and during air travel should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycemia and dehydration, which can increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Instead, water or non-alcoholic sugar-free drinks should be consumed liberally to stay hydrated.

----
[BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING DURING AIR TRAVEL]
Blood glucose levels should be monitored frequently while in transit and when changing time zones. It's often safer to allow in-flight blood glucose values to be slightly higher than usual to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. This requires regular monitoring and adjustments to insulin dosages as needed.

----
[INSULIN TREATMENT DURING AIR TRAVEL]
There is no evidence-based information on how to adjust insulin dosages during flights that cross several time zones. Each case should be discussed individually with the patient, taking into account the duration of the flight, change in time zone, and usual insulin preparations and dosages. General guidelines suggest not aiming for strict blood glucose control while flying and using small additional insulin dosages rather than risking hypoglycemia.

----
[GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR INSULIN TREATMENT DURING AIR TRAVEL]
Guiding principles for insulin treatment during air travel include not aiming for strict blood glucose control, checking blood glucose levels every 2-3 hours, and adjusting the insulin schedule according to the time change. For time changes of less than 4 hours, the usual insulin schedule can be maintained, while westward flights may require adjustments to the insulin schedule to avoid hypoglycemia.

----
[BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING EQUIPMENT]
Blood glucose meters and test strips can be affected by extreme temperatures and high altitudes, although cabin pressure on passenger aircraft should not pose problems. It's sensible to carry a spare meter and/or visually read glucose strips in case the meter fails, especially when traveling to areas with limited access to medical supplies.

----
[ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT DURING AIR TRAVEL]
Individuals with diabetes should consider additional factors when traveling, such as taking anti-emetic medication to prevent nausea and vomiting, carrying antidiarrheal agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and wearing comfortable and appropriate footwear to prevent foot ulceration. These precautions can help minimize the risk of complications and ensure a safe and enjoyable trip.
----
[INSULIN DOSAGE DURING LONG FLIGHTS]
When taking extremely long flights with a time shift of 12 hours or more, patients may require two consecutive "morning" or "evening" insulin dosages to be injected before and after the flight. Additional insulin needed to fill in long gaps between delayed-action injections or to correct hyperglycemia is best given as small doses of soluble or rapid-acting analogue. This can be ideally administered using a pen injection device. Patients should monitor their blood glucose levels frequently during travel.

----
[INSULIN TREATMENT IN HOT CLIMATES]
A patient's insulin requirements may change significantly in different countries due to differences in diet and daily physical activity. High ambient temperatures can accelerate subcutaneous insulin absorption, and modern insulin formulations can be unstable if exposed to high temperatures and shaken. This can result in discolored particles or a granular appearance, which is distinct from the normal cloudiness of delayed-action preparations.

----
[MANAGING DIABETES DURING TIME ZONE TRAVEL]
When traveling across time zones, patients should adjust their insulin doses accordingly. For eastward flights, the previous dose of delayed-action insulin should be reduced if the interval between injections is less than 12 hours. For westward flights, additional insulin may be needed if the day is lengthened by more than 8 hours. Patients should always monitor their blood glucose levels 2-3 hourly and relax glycemic control during travel.

----
[PRE-TRAVEL PREPARATIONS FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Before traveling, patients should obtain advice from their diabetes clinic and gather essential information about their flight, including departure and arrival times. They should also inform the airline about their diabetes, especially if they are treated with insulin, and carry extra supplies of carbohydrate. Additionally, patients should anticipate potential delays and ensure they can monitor their blood glucose levels frequently during travel.
----

----
[DIABETES MONITORING]
Monitoring diabetes is crucial to achieve near-normal physiological values without detriment to quality of life. The overall goal of diabetes management is to maintain glucose levels within a normal range, and monitoring helps to diagnose any impairment of homeostatic mechanisms and guide therapeutic interventions. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood glucose are the two most frequently used measures of glycemia in current practice. HbA1c provides information about overall control of glucose levels, while blood glucose concentrations provide information about day-to-day level of control.

----
[GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) LEVELS]
Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are increasingly presented using the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry standard, expressed as mmol/mol of unglycated hemoglobin. The equivalent of the current HbA1c levels of 6.5% and 7.5% are 48 mmol/mol and 59 mmol/mol, respectively. HbA1c levels are used to assess the need for therapy and therapeutic response, with minimal within-person variation in measurement. Prospective observational and intervention studies have confirmed that HbA1c levels are related to long-term disease outcomes.

----
[MONITORING FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES]
For patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), blood glucose control should be monitored with measurement of HbA1c every 2-6 months, depending on the level and stability of blood glucose control and change in therapy. Patients with T1DM should be encouraged to self-monitor blood glucose with capillary blood glucose meters, with frequent testing (e.g., four or more times a day) for intensive glycemic control. This helps to adjust management regimens and maintain optimal blood glucose levels.

----
[MONITORING FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
For patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), blood glucose control should be monitored using high-precision methods for measurement of HbA1c every 2-6 months, depending on the level and stability of blood glucose control and change in therapy. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is unlikely to be cost-effective for well-controlled patients and should only be used when training and support are available and a clear purpose for use is identified. This approach helps to optimize therapy and minimize the risk of complications.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING]
Diabetes is a disorder of glucose homeostasis that affects 285 million people worldwide, and monitoring is essential to achieve optimal glucose control. The aim of monitoring glycemic control is to diagnose the nature of any impairment of homeostatic mechanisms, allow patients to understand their disorder, and guide therapeutic interventions. By monitoring blood glucose and HbA1c levels, healthcare providers can adjust management regimens and help patients maintain optimal blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of long-term complications.
----
[GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN MEASUREMENT]
Glycated hemoglobin serves as a retrospective indicator of the average glucose concentration over the previous 6-8 weeks. Quality controlled HbA1c measurement has a central role in the management of diabetes, and its pivotal role derives from its use in reports of major outcome studies. HbA1c levels can be directly related to the risk of development of diabetic complications. 
----
[FACTORS AFFECTING HBA1C RESULTS]
Vitamin C, hemolytic and iron deficiency anemia, and other conditions with rapid turnover of erythrocytes can give abnormal HbA1c results. Laboratories may differ in reporting results from patients with variant hemoglobin, and some conditions may require special consideration when interpreting HbA1c results. 
----
[GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN FORMATION]
Hemoglobin reacts spontaneously with glucose to form glycated derivatives in a non-enzymatic manner, with the extent of glycation determined by the concentration of glucose in blood. Human hemoglobin A undergoes glycation to form HbA1c, which is now widely accepted as a standard measurement of glycemic control. 
----
[CONDITIONS AFFECTING HBA1C MEASUREMENT]
Conditions such as iron deficiency anemia, hemoglobinopathies, polycythemia, blood transfusion, hemolysis, and uremia caused by renal failure can affect the measurement of glycated hemoglobin. High levels of vitamin C can also impact HbA1c results, and it is essential to consider these factors when interpreting glycated hemoglobin measurements.
----
[INTRODUCTION TO ESTIMATED AVERAGE GLUCOSE MEASUREMENT]
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has proposed an alternative approach to measuring blood glucose levels, introducing the estimated average glucose measurement (eAG), which is related to glycated hemoglobin levels and formulas. This approach aims to provide a more accurate representation of average blood glucose levels. The eAG measurement is based on a formula that correlates continuous blood glucose monitoring results with HbA1c levels. 

----
[RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HbA1c AND eAG]
A large international study has established a strong correlation between continuous blood glucose monitoring results and HbA1c, leading to the development of a formula to derive eAG. However, concerns about the generalizability of this relationship and limited information about its applicability to all ethnic groups have led to limited adoption outside the USA. The relationship between eAG and diabetes complications is also controversial, with no long-term studies relating continuous blood glucose measurement to long-term diabetes outcomes.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES USING HbA1c]
Current guidance recommends that the diagnosis of diabetes is based on at least two laboratory measurements of blood glucose, with HbA1c remaining a target of intervention in many trials and a measure of success in improving glycemic control. The diagnosis of diabetes can also be based on random samples of blood glucose or an oral glucose tolerance test in cases of uncertainty. 

----
[ALIGNMENT OF HbA1c ASSAYS]
The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has developed a new reference standard for HbA1c measurement, which aims to standardize results across different laboratories and assays. Despite these efforts, there are still over 30 different methods in use for measuring HbA1c, and manufacturers provide calibration factors for individual machines to ensure comparability.
----
[COLLECTING BLOOD SAMPLES FOR GLUCOSE MEASUREMENT]
To accurately measure glucose levels, blood samples should be collected in controlled conditions and handled properly to prevent glycolysis. Rapid centrifugation, collection onto ice, and storage in a refrigerator can help preserve the sample. If transportation at room temperature is necessary, fluoride-containing tubes can inhibit glucose metabolism. 
----
[BLOOD GLUCOSE MEASUREMENT UNITS]
Blood glucose levels are typically expressed in SI units as millimoles/liter (mmol/L), although traditional units of milligrams/decilitre (mg/dL) are still used in some countries, such as the USA. To convert mmol/L to mg/dL, multiply by 18. 
----
[WHOLE BLOOD VS PLASMA GLUCOSE MEASUREMENT]
Whole blood glucose concentrations are 12-15% lower than plasma concentrations due to the presence of protein, mainly hemoglobin. This difference should be considered when interpreting glucose measurements. 
----
[HBa1C MEASUREMENT AND DIAGNOSIS]
HbA1c offers a potentially easier and more acceptable test for diabetes diagnosis, with less intra-individual variation than glucose testing. The proposed diagnostic threshold for HbA1c is 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), although this may not be universally available or adopted. 
----
[POINT-OF-CARE HBA1C TESTING]
Point-of-care testing for HbA1c is now possible with clinic-based analyzers, allowing for timely decisions on therapy changes. However, the benefits of widespread deployment are still being studied and have not been fully established. 
----
[MEASUREMENT OF FRUCTOSAMINE]
Fructosamine measurement reflects glucose levels over the previous 1-3 weeks and can be useful in certain circumstances, such as pregnancy or renal disease. However, the assay is not standardized and can be affected by excessive albumin turnover or excretion, limiting its routine use.
----
[MONITORING DIABETES]
Monitoring diabetes involves careful measurement of blood glucose levels to minimize errors and ensure accurate calculations of insulin doses. Measurement error can be minimized by careful training, consistent technique, and regular testing to identify unusual patterns. Blood glucose meters are helpful, especially at higher blood glucose values, but their imprecision can have significant consequences at lower plasma glucose levels.

----
[MEASUREMENT OF URINARY GLUCOSE]
Measurement of glucose in urine has limited use for routine monitoring of diabetes due to its inability to reflect changing levels of hyperglycemia accurately. Urine testing is rapid, inexpensive, and non-invasive, but its interpretation can be difficult, and it may not provide accurate results due to variations in renal threshold between individuals. The enzyme used in urine testing, glucose oxidase/peroxidase, can also lead to false-positive or false-negative results.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL ASSESSMENT]
Glycated hemoglobin measurement is recommended to assess the maintenance of glycemic control and should be measured with high precision methods. Results should be reported in IFCC units or eAG units alongside DCCT-aligned units. HbA1c measurements should be performed at least twice a year in patients with stable glycemic control and more frequently when levels are unstable or after changes in therapy.

----
[ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR BLOOD GLUCOSE MEASUREMENT]
A range of analytical techniques are used for laboratory measurement of blood glucose levels, including chemical oxidation/reduction methods and enzymatic analysis. The enzymatic reference method for glucose is the hexokinase/G6PDH method, while glucose oxidase methods are frequently used due to their convenience and lower cost. However, the presence of reducing substances may cause errors in glucose oxidase methods.
----
[GLUCOSE MONITORING]
Glucose monitoring is crucial for managing diabetes, and patients should be encouraged to use self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) using capillary blood glucose meters. With treatment regimens intended to produce intensive glycemic control, testing should be frequent, such as four or more times a day. This allows for the identification of periods during the day when plasma glucose levels are higher or lower than ideal and appropriate adjustment of insulin injections.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY MONITORING]
When using a typical basal bolus regimen, at least four time-points during the day need to be monitored, including pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and before bedtime. Additionally, testing 1 hour post-meals may allow for more accurate adjustment of pre-meal short-acting insulin, although this may be offset by greater inconvenience. Frequent glucose testing enables the identification of periods when plasma glucose levels are higher or lower than ideal, allowing for adjustments to be made.

----
[GLYCEMIC TARGETS]
Glycemic targets for adults are an HbA1c of 48-59 mmol/mol (6.5-7.5%), while targets for children (aged 0-12 years) are higher due to the high risk of and vulnerability to hypoglycemia. These targets are essential for guiding treatment and monitoring the effectiveness of therapy.

----
[SELF-MONITORING OF BLOOD GLUCOSE]
Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a standard of care for patients with type 1 diabetes and necessary for insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. SMBG may also be helpful for some non-insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, although its optimal use in this group is not established. Patients using SMBG require a high level of motivation and need to be taught how to interpret results and take appropriate actions.

----
[RISK OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Tight control of blood glucose levels brings with it the risk of hypoglycemia, which may be inappropriate for some individuals, such as those with a limited duration of life or inability to make adjustments required for tight control. Accepting less tight control allows for the use of less complicated regimens and less frequent monitoring, reducing the risk of hypoglycemia.
----
[SELF-MONITORING OF BLOOD GLUCOSE]
Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been shown to improve glycemia, with a decrease in HbA1c of 0.2% in trials of at least 6 months' duration. However, trials that compared SMBG with no SMBG, including state-of-the-art patient education, did not show a benefit. SMBG may be helpful for patients with less well-controlled diabetes, but it also carries the risk of adverse outcomes such as depression and anxiety.
----
[ADJUSTMENT OF ORAL GLUCOSE-LOWERING MEDICATION]
One recent trial found that using SMBG to titrate oral glucose-lowering medication resulted in a small but significant improvement in glycemic control compared to usual care. Further studies are needed to explore the long-term advantages of SMBG compared to other management strategies, such as frequent HbA1c measurement.
----
[COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SMBG]
Studies on the cost-effectiveness of SMBG for non-insulin-treated patients have yielded varying results, with some suggesting that the benefits of improved glucose control may be balanced out by the impact on quality of life. Even when modeled over a long-term time horizon, SMBG may not reach a conventional threshold of cost-effectiveness.
----
[STRUCTURED SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM]
SMBG should only be used as part of a structured self-management program and when it serves an identified purpose in self-management. The frequency and timing of testing, as well as how users act on the results, are still unresolved questions that require further study.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Women with gestational diabetes should be advised to test fasting blood glucose levels and blood glucose levels 1 hour after every meal during pregnancy, and adjust their insulin dose to maintain target blood glucose levels. Many oral glucose-lowering medicines are not recommended for use during pregnancy.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
For patients with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose control should be monitored using high-precision methods for measurement of HbA1c every 2-6 months, depending on the level and stability of blood glucose control and change in therapy. Insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes need to make use of SMBG, particularly during the period of titration of insulin doses.
----
[MANAGING DIABETES]
Managing diabetes involves a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring of blood glucose levels. Patients are often asked to provide blood for HbA1c testing before a clinic visit to assess their glycemic control and guide treatment decisions. HbA1c testing can indicate clinically relevant changes in blood glucose levels, with differences of 0.5% suggesting the need for changes in treatment or lifestyle. This information helps healthcare providers make informed decisions about patient care.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD GLUCOSE TESTING]
Blood glucose testing is essential for patients with diabetes, particularly those with type 1 diabetes and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. Regular testing helps patients understand the impact of diabetes and treatment on their blood glucose levels and adjust their medication accordingly. Detailed records of blood glucose measurements and actions are necessary for review by both the patient and their clinician, allowing for informed decisions about therapy adjustments.

----
[POST-MEAL AND FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE MEASUREMENTS]
Post-meal glucose measurements can be used as a screening tool to identify inadequately controlled patients, while fasting blood glucose measurements can inform management for patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Pre-prandial blood glucose levels can be useful for evaluating the impact of complex insulin schedules, particularly with fast-acting analog insulin. For insulin-treated patients, pre-breakfast levels can indicate the effectiveness of long-acting insulin.

----
[MONITORING DIABETES IN HOSPITAL SETTINGS]
In hospital settings, laboratory and point-of-care testing should be supported by certified quality assurance schemes to ensure accurate blood glucose measurements. Meters used in hospitals should have quality assurance procedures in place, such as restricting access to trained personnel and transferring results directly to the electronic patient record. Blood glucose measurements should be available from meters situated on hospital wards, and measurement of glucose on admission to hospital is necessary to identify hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia and provide appropriate patient care.
----
[CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEMS]
Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMS) have been shown to be effective in reducing HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes, with a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c levels compared to conventional therapy. The success of CGMS correlates with adherence to the ongoing use of the device. CGMS has also been evaluated for pregnant women with diabetes, showing improved glycemic control in the third trimester, lower birth weight, and reduced risk of macrosomia.
----
[RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS]
In resource-poor settings, the costs of Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) using test meters remain high, making it challenging for patients to access. Urine glucose testing remains a viable alternative to blood testing or HbA1c measurement in such settings, although it has its limitations, including a higher renal threshold for glucose and limited information about glucose levels below this threshold.
----
[SELF-MONITORING OF BLOOD GLUCOSE]
Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) may provide patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) with insight into the impact of day-to-day activities on blood glucose levels. SMBG can also be used to measure fasting glucose as an alternative indicator of overall glycemic control, and to characterize the extent of hyperglycemia after meals.
----
[FUTURE RESEARCH]
Current research is focusing on non-invasive methods for continuous glucose monitoring, which may provide more convenient and accessible options for patients with diabetes. The development of these methods will require consideration of individual variations in measurement techniques, lifestyle, and availability of professional support.
----
[DIABETES RESEARCH STUDIES]
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Study Research Group found that intensive diabetes treatment can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association has also published clinical practice recommendations for diabetes care. Additionally, studies have shown that intensive glucose control can have long-term benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[GLUCOSE MONITORING GUIDELINES]
The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions and the American Diabetes Association have published guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes, including recommendations for laboratory analysis and glucose monitoring. The guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate and reliable glucose monitoring, including the use of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) tests and estimated average glucose values.

----
[GLUCOSE MONITORING TECHNOLOGY]
Research has validated the use of algorithms combining HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Near-patient testing for glycated hemoglobin has also been shown to be acceptable and satisfactory for people with type 2 diabetes managed in primary care. Furthermore, studies have evaluated the accuracy and reliability of home blood glucose meters and bedside blood glucose monitoring in hospitals.

----
[SELF-MONITORING OF BLOOD GLUCOSE]
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is an important aspect of diabetes management, and studies have explored patients' perspectives on self-monitoring and its impact on long-term outcomes. Research has shown that self-monitoring can be beneficial for patients with type 2 diabetes, and that it can be used to inform treatment decisions and improve glucose control.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF SELF-MONITORING OF BLOOD GLUCOSE]
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is a crucial aspect of diabetes management, and its effectiveness has been studied in various clinical trials. Studies have shown that self-monitoring can improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes, particularly in patients not using insulin. A meta-analysis of 1966-2004 data found that self-monitoring as part of a multi-component therapy can be beneficial for non-insulin requiring type 2 diabetes patients.

----
[CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING]
Continuous glucose monitoring has been found to be effective in intensive treatment of type 1 diabetes, as well as in pregnant women with diabetes. A randomized controlled clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2008 found that continuous glucose monitoring can improve glucose control in type 1 diabetes. Another study published in the British Medical Journal in 2008 found that continuous glucose monitoring can be effective in pregnant women with diabetes.

----
[COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SELF-MONITORING]
The cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes has been evaluated in several studies. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2008 found that self-monitoring can be cost-effective, particularly in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Another study published in the same journal found that self-monitoring can be cost-effective in patients with type 2 diabetes not using insulin.

----
[TELEMONITORING AND MOBILE HEALTH TECHNOLOGY]
Telemonitoring and mobile health technology can support young adults with type 1 diabetes, according to a study published in Informatics in Primary Care in 2005. The study found that a real-time, mobile phone-based telemedicine system can improve glucose control and quality of life in young adults with type 1 diabetes.

----
[CLINICAL TRIALS AND STUDIES]
Several clinical trials and studies have investigated the effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Fremantle Diabetes Study, published in Diabetologia in 2007, found that self-monitoring can improve outcome in type 2 diabetes. Other studies, such as the ESMON study and the DiGEM trial, have also found that self-monitoring can be effective in patients with type 2 diabetes.
----
[DRUG INTERACTIONS AND DIABETES]
Many drugs can interfere with glucose homeostasis or interact with antidiabetic agents, disturbing glycemic control in people with diabetes. Specific diabetic complications, such as nephropathy and neuropathy, may require particular drugs to be used with care. Hyperglycemia can be caused or worsened by numerous drugs, including glucocorticoids, certain oral contraceptives, and antipsychotic drugs. These drugs can induce insulin resistance, leading to elevated blood glucose levels.

----
[DRUG-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Drugs that induce insulin resistance, such as glucocorticoids, certain oral contraceptives, antipsychotic drugs, HIV protease inhibitors, and β-adrenoceptor antagonists, can cause or worsen hyperglycemia. Additionally, diabetogenic drugs like pentamidine and cyclosporine can damage the β-cell, leading to hyperglycemia. These drugs can be particularly problematic for people with diabetes, as they can exacerbate existing glycemic control issues.

----
[DRUG-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Certain drugs, such as sulfonylureas and related agents, can cause hypoglycemia by interacting with other drugs that block their metabolism in the liver or impair renal function. Other drugs, like quinine and sulfamethoxazole, can stimulate insulin secretion, leading to hypoglycemia. Additionally, pentamidine can induce transient hypoglycemia by causing passive loss of insulin from the β-cell.

----
[MANAGING DRUG THERAPY IN DIABETES]
When managing drug therapy in patients with diabetes, it is essential to consider the potential effects of various drugs on glycemic control. Certain drugs, like metformin and sulfonylureas, are contraindicated in advanced nephropathy, and others, such as vasodilators and ganglion-blocking agents, can exacerbate postural hypotension. Thiazide diuretics, on the other hand, can be used at low dosages to effectively lower blood pressure in patients with diabetes.

----
[SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
Patients with diabetic complications, such as nephropathy and neuropathy, require special consideration when using certain drugs. For example, metformin and sulfonylureas are cleared through the kidney and should not be used in advanced nephropathy or co-administered with nephrotoxic drugs. Non-selective β-adrenoceptor antagonists can also impair glucose tolerance and decrease awareness of hypoglycemia, making them less suitable for patients with diabetes.
----
[DRUG-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Certain drugs, such as the antibiotic gatifloxacin, can cause hyperglycemia, while others can lower blood glucose concentration. These drugs can interact with glucose-lowering medications or act as insulin secretagogues, enhancing the effect of insulin. It is essential to consider drug interactions when managing diabetes. 
----
[DRUG-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Some drugs, including non-selective β-adrenoceptor antagonists, can cause hypoglycemia by blocking warning symptoms or neuroendocrine counter-regulatory responses. Patients with previously well-controlled diabetes who experience unexplained hypoglycemic episodes should be evaluated for potential drug interactions, including prescription, herbal, and alternative medicines.
----
[MECHANISMS OF DRUG-INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Drugs can induce hyperglycemia by inhibiting insulin release, causing insulin resistance, or increasing hepatic glucose output. On the other hand, drugs can induce hypoglycemia by enhancing insulin secretion, increasing glucose uptake, or suppressing hepatic glucose output. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for managing diabetes and preventing drug-induced hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
----
[SULFONYLUREAS AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Sulfonylureas, such as glibenclamide and chlorpropamide, can cause symptomatic hypoglycemia, especially in patients taking long-acting formulations. The risk of severe hypoglycemia is higher with glibenclamide compared to shorter-acting sulfonylureas like tolbutamide, gliclazide, or glipizide, with a reported risk of two episodes per 1000 persons per year.
----
[DRUGS THAT EXACERBATE HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Drugs that may cause or exacerbate hyperglycemia include glucocorticoids, oral contraceptives, thiazide diuretics, and certain antipsychotics, among others. These medications can increase blood glucose levels, making it challenging to manage diabetes. It is essential to monitor blood glucose levels closely when taking these medications. 

----
[DRUGS THAT EXACERBATE HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Drugs that may cause or exacerbate hypoglycemia include antidiabetic drugs, such as insulins and sulfonylureas, as well as other medications like quinolone antibacterials and corticosteroids. These medications can increase the risk of hypoglycemia, especially when combined with other factors like age, renal impairment, or reduced food intake.

----
[SULFONYLUREA-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia can be profound and prolonged, and difficult to manage. Patients with sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia may require admission and treatment with glucose until the effect of the sulfonylurea has worn off. Insulin hypersecretion induced by sulfonylureas can be suppressed effectively with either diazoxide or the somatostatin analog octreotide.

----
[MANAGING SULFONYLUREA-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Managing sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia requires caution, as it can be challenging to treat. Patients may require intravenous glucose and close monitoring of blood glucose levels. In some cases, medications like diazoxide or octreotide may be used to suppress insulin hypersecretion and manage hypoglycemia.
----
[DRUG THERAPY CONSIDERATIONS]
When managing diabetes, it's essential to consider the potential interactions between oral hypoglycemic agents and other drugs. Factors such as excretion, toxicity, and hypoglycemic effect must be taken into account. Additionally, the metabolism and clearance of these drugs, including hepatic and renal clearance, can be affected by other medications like ketoconazole and cimetidine.

----
[ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS]
Common oral hypoglycemic agents include Glibenclamide, Repaglinide, and Metformin. These drugs can have varying effects on blood glucose levels and may interact with other medications, highlighting the need for careful consideration and monitoring. The hypoglycemic effect of these agents can be influenced by factors such as hepatic clearance and renal function.

----
[HERBAL INTERACTIONS]
Certain herbal medicinal products and food supplements can potentially interact with antidiabetic drugs, affecting blood glucose concentrations. Examples of herbs that can lower blood glucose levels include Alfalfa, Aloe vera, and Fenugreek, while others like Bee pollen and Devil's claw may increase blood glucose levels. It's crucial for individuals with diabetes to be aware of these potential interactions and consult with their healthcare provider before using any herbal remedies.

----
[FOOD SUPPLEMENT INTERACTIONS]
Various food supplements can also interact with antidiabetic drugs, either increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels. For instance, Ginseng, Guar gum, and Melatonin may lower blood glucose, whereas Gotu kola, Licorice, and St. John's wort may increase it. Understanding these interactions is vital to ensure safe and effective management of diabetes.
----
[ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
Metformin is not expected to cause hypoglycemia when used alone, but instances of hypoglycemia have been reported. Thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, potentiate the peripheral actions of insulin and can enhance hypoglycemia caused by sulfonylureas or insulin. Repaglinide stimulates insulin release and can cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Acarbose inhibits intestinal disaccharidase and reduces glucose absorption, but does not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy.

----
[INCRETIN THERAPY]
Exenatide and liraglutide are incretins that enhance the pancreatic insulin response to glucose in the gut, slowing down stomach emptying and stimulating insulin secretion. They do not tend to cause hypoglycemia and also increase pancreatic β-cell mass and promote weight loss. Gliptins increase the circulating levels of incretins by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and are indicated for glycemic control as alternatives to thiazolidinediones or acarbose in patients with T2DM on metformin therapy.

----
[INHALED INSULIN]
Inhaled insulin preparations deliver insulin by the pulmonary route and have a value in patients who have a phobia of needles. However, due to poor sales and safety concerns, the first inhaled insulin marketed has been withdrawn, and its use is currently limited.

----
[ANTIMICROBIALS AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Quinine and quinine derivatives can cause hypoglycemia due to insulin hypersecretion, particularly in patients with falciparum malaria. Octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, has been used to inhibit insulin release and raise blood glucose concentrations in these cases. Other antimicrobials, such as sulfamethoxazole, can also stimulate insulin secretion and cause hypoglycemia, especially in elderly patients or those with renal failure.
----
[DRUG INTERACTIONS AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Drug interactions can increase the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetes patients, particularly with sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, and glipizide. Certain medications like azapropazone, oral chloramphenicol, and fluconazole can potentiate the effects of these sulfonylureas, leading to hypoglycemia. Additionally, miconazole and ciprofloxacin can also interact with sulfonylureas to increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

----
[INDIVIDUAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Some patients may be more susceptible to drug-induced hypoglycemia due to various factors, such as liver disease or genetic variations in the CYP2C9 enzyme. For example, patients taking levothyroxine with liver disease may be at increased risk of mild hypoglycemia. Individuals with genetically determined low CYP2C9 activity may also be at higher risk of sulfonylurea-associated severe hypoglycemia.

----
[COMPARISON OF HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK AMONG SULFONYLUREAS]
A meta-analysis suggests that glibenclamide is associated with a higher risk of hypoglycemia compared to other insulin secretagogues, with a relative risk of 1.52. This highlights the importance of careful selection and monitoring of sulfonylureas in diabetes management.

----
[INTERACTIONS WITH NON-DIABETES MEDICATIONS]
Certain non-diabetes medications, such as aspirin and other salicylates, can inhibit hepatic glucose production and increase peripheral glucose utilization, leading to hypoglycemia. Ethanol can also cause hypoglycemia by inhibiting gluconeogenesis, particularly in children or fasting adults.

----
[HERBAL AND FOLK REMEDIES]
Some herbal, traditional, and folk remedies may contain compounds with glucose-lowering properties, but these are generally weak and can be unpredictable. In some cases, these remedies have been found to contain undeclared sulfonylureas, which can cause severe hypoglycemia.
----
[DIABETES AND BETA-BLOCKERS]
Beta-blockers, specifically β-adrenoceptor antagonists, can interfere with glucose homeostasis and may not be the best choice for people with diabetes due to their potential to increase insulin resistance. However, they may still be used in combination with other medications to control blood pressure, which is often a concern for individuals with diabetes. Cardioselective β1-adrenoceptor antagonists are preferred in patients treated with insulin or sulfonylureas as they are less likely to interfere with awareness of or recovery from hypoglycemia.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA SYMPTOMS AND BETA-BLOCKERS]
Beta-blockers can mask hypoglycemia symptoms, such as tremors and sweating, which are typically mediated by β2-adrenoceptors. Non-selective β-adrenoceptor antagonists can delay recovery from hypoglycemia and reduce the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. In contrast, cardioselective β1-adrenoceptor antagonists rarely impair recognition of hypoglycemia and do not increase the incidence of hypoglycemia.

----
[INTERACTIONS WITH METFORMIN]
Metformin has a high renal clearance, and certain medications, such as cimetidine, can reduce its clearance and cause it to accumulate. Other medications, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and aminoglycosides, can also increase metformin concentrations, raising the risk of lactic acidosis. Therefore, these medications should be used with caution in patients taking metformin.

----
[DIABETES AND BLOOD PRESSURE MANAGEMENT]
People with diabetes often have a more stringent blood pressure target (130/85 mmHg), which may require the use of multiple classes of medications to control blood pressure. In such cases, beta-blockers could be added to the treatment regimen, despite their potential effects on insulin resistance. Additionally, individuals with diabetes frequently have ischemic heart disease, which is another indication for β-adrenoceptor antagonists.
----
[ACE INHIBITORS IN DIABETES CARE]
ACE inhibitors do not cause hyperglycemia and do not adversely affect lipid metabolism. They may improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood glucose concentrations, but can occasionally cause severe hypoglycemia. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with renal artery stenosis due to the high risk of renal impairment. 
----
[ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS FOR DIABETES]
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are indicated for hypertension, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, and diabetic nephropathy. They have been shown to reduce the risk of new-onset diabetes and may also reduce the risk of stroke and mortality in patients with diabetes. ARBs have similar benefits to ACE inhibitors in patients with diabetes.
----
[CALCIUM-CHANNEL BLOCKERS AND DIABETES]
Calcium-channel blockers may impair glucose metabolism, but when used appropriately, they are as safe in patients with diabetes as in those without diabetes. They are relatively more efficacious in lowering blood pressure in people of Asian or African origin, which is especially relevant in populations with a high incidence of stroke.
----
[BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONISTS IN DIABETES CARE]
Concerns about the adverse metabolic effects of β1-selective adrenoceptor antagonists have been exaggerated, and their cardioprotective effects should not be underestimated. Low-dose β-adrenoceptor antagonists are relatively safe in older, vulnerable patients, including those with diabetes.
----
[RENAL IMPAIRMENT AND ACE INHIBITORS]
ACE inhibitors can cause renal impairment in patients with renal artery stenosis, which can be reversible but sometimes permanent. This is a significant consideration in patients with both hypertension and type 2 diabetes, as renal artery stenosis may be present in up to 20% of these patients.
----
[DIURETICS AND DIABETES]
Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, can cause hyperglycemia by inhibiting enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, leading to poor glucose utilization. However, in practice, few problems are encountered when using loop diuretics in people with diabetes, as any insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are often a consequence of the underlying condition requiring diuretic therapy. Effective treatment of hyperglycemia is crucial in managing diabetes.

----
[ANTIHYPERLIPIDEMIC AGENTS AND DIABETES]
The relationship between diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia is complex, and treating hyperglycemia can often ameliorate hypertriglyceridemia. Conversely, lowering lipid levels can improve blood glucose control. As a result, drugs are often prescribed independently for diet-resistant hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, making interactions between agents potentially important.

----
[STATINS AND DIABETES]
Statins, or hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors, pose few problems for people with diabetes and can provide the same relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events as for those without diabetes. In fact, diabetes is often regarded as an indication for lipid-lowering therapy due to the higher absolute risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.

----
[FIBRATES AND DIABETES]
Fibrates, such as clofibrate and bezafibrate, have been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes taking sulfonylureas or metformin. However, these observations have not been widely pursued, and more research is needed to fully understand their benefits.

----
[NICOTINIC ACID AND DIABETES]
Nicotinic acid, or niacin, is an effective treatment for dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes and does not appear to interact with antidiabetic therapy. However, it can cause hyperglycemia and unpleasant flushing, although a slow-release formulation is available that causes less flushing. Acipimox, an analog of nicotinic acid, does not cause hyperglycemia.

----
[ANION-EXCHANGE RESINS AND DIABETES]
Anion-exchange resins, such as cholestyramine, could theoretically reduce the absorption of antidiabetic drugs from the gut, although clinically significant interference has not been reported. In contrast, ezetimibe does not have this effect, making it a potentially safer option.

----
[ACE INHIBITORS AND ARBS IN DIABETES]
There are no trials demonstrating that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are superior to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in terms of outcome, and ARBs are currently more expensive. However, ARBs do not cause the characteristic dry cough associated with ACE inhibitors, making them a potential alternative.

----
[α1-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONISTS AND DIABETES]
α1-Adrenoceptor antagonists are effective hypotensive agents that can have beneficial metabolic effects, including improved insulin sensitivity and falls in blood insulin, glucose, and lipid concentrations. However, one report suggests that the use of doxazosin may worsen glycemic control in patients with diabetes, and these drugs are not currently in extensive use due to the side effect of postural hypotension.
----
[DRUG THERAPY CONSIDERATIONS IN DIABETES]
When managing diabetes, certain medications require special caution due to potential interactions or exacerbation of diabetic complications. For example, oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies should be used with caution in women with diabetes and severe vascular disease. Additionally, certain medications like growth hormone and propranolol should be avoided in patients with specific diabetic complications.

----
[CONTRAINDICATED MEDICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Some medications are relatively or absolutely contraindicated in patients with certain diabetic complications, such as oral contraceptives in women with diabetes and severe vascular disease, and growth hormone in patients with proliferative retinopathy. Other medications, like oxymetazoline hydrochloride nasal spray and verruca gels containing salicylic acid, also have contraindications or warnings for use in patients with diabetes.

----
[COMBINED STATIN AND FIBRATE THERAPY]
Combined statin and fibrate therapy may be indicated for dyslipidemia that is refractory to treatment with single agents, but it increases the risk of myalgia and muscle damage. The risks of these complications are substantially increased by co-administration of statins and fibrates.

----
[RENAL COMPLICATIONS AND MEDICATIONS]
In patients with diabetic nephropathy, certain medications like sulfonylureas and metformin require caution due to the risk of accumulation and toxicity. ACE inhibitors or ARBs may also require careful monitoring of renal function, while NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors should be avoided if possible.

----
[CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND MEDICATIONS]
In patients with cardiovascular disease, certain medications like β-adrenoceptor antagonists and thiazide diuretics may worsen glycemic control or exacerbate hyperlipidemia. Alternative antihypertensive or antianginal drugs may be considered to minimize these risks.

----
[AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY AND MEDICATIONS]
In patients with autonomic neuropathy, certain medications like phosphodiesterase inhibitors and ganglion-blocking agents may aggravate postural hypotension. These medications should be used with caution, especially in the elderly and those taking nitrates.
----
[DRUG-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Drug-induced hypoglycemia is a condition where certain medications cause abnormally low blood sugar levels. Various studies have reported cases of hypoglycemia induced by different drugs, including gatifloxacin, inhaled corticosteroids, doxycycline, and valproate. These cases highlight the importance of monitoring blood sugar levels in patients taking these medications.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA IN DIABETIC PATIENTS]
Hypoglycemia is a common complication in diabetic patients, particularly those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Studies have shown that sulphonylureas, a class of oral hypoglycemic agents, can increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. The risk of hypoglycemia is higher with long-acting sulphonylureas compared to short-acting ones.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The management of hypoglycemia involves prompt treatment with glucose or other carbohydrates to raise blood sugar levels. In severe cases, hospital admission may be necessary. It is essential to identify the underlying cause of hypoglycemia, including drug-induced cases, to provide appropriate treatment and prevent future episodes.

----
[THROMBOLYTIC TREATMENT IN DIABETIC PATIENTS]
Thrombolytic treatment, such as streptokinase, may be used to treat myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes. However, there has been controversy about the risks of inducing vitreous hemorrhage in patients with proliferative retinopathy. Current advice is to give thrombolytic drugs according to the usual indications, as the benefits outweigh the potential risks to vision.
----
[DRUG INTERACTIONS AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Certain medications, such as disopyramide and cibenzoline, can increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes. Additionally, the use of nefazodone, a medication for major depression, can also induce hypoglycemia in diabetic patients. It is essential to monitor blood glucose levels when using these medications.

----
[ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]

Certain medications, such as ciprofloxacin, can interact with oral hypoglycemics like glyburide, leading to resistant hypoglycemia. Additionally, the use of thyroid agents can increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with liver impairment. Healthcare providers should carefully monitor patients for potential drug interactions.

----
[GENETIC FACTORS AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Genetic variations, such as CYP2C9 slow metabolizer genotypes, can increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia in patients taking sulphonylurea hypoglycemic agents. Understanding these genetic factors can help healthcare providers tailor diabetes treatment plans to individual patients' needs.

----
[BETA-BLOCKERS AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Beta-blockers may be used in hypertensive diabetic patients, but their use requires careful consideration. Some studies suggest that beta-blockers can mask hypoglycemic symptoms, making it essential to monitor blood glucose levels closely when using these medications.
----
[ACE INHIBITORS AND DIABETES]
ACE inhibitors have been studied for their effects on glucose metabolism in patients with diabetes. Some studies have found that ACE inhibitors do not have a significant impact on glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetes, while others have suggested that they may improve insulin action and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, ACE inhibitors have also been associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes.

----
[ANGIOTENSIN-RECEPTOR BLOCKADE IN DIABETES]
Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) have been compared to ACE inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, with some studies suggesting that ARBs may be more effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE) found that losartan was more effective than atenolol in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes.

[RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITION AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in some studies. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system was associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the exact mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood.

----
[ALPHA-1 INHIBITORS AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY]
Alpha-1 inhibitors, such as doxazosin and prazosin, have been found to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with hypertension. Studies have shown that these medications can increase insulin sensitivity and improve glucose metabolism in obese patients with hypertension. However, the clinical significance of these findings is not fully understood.
----
[DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION]
The treatment of hypertension is crucial in patients with diabetes, as high blood pressure can exacerbate diabetes-related complications. Studies such as the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) have investigated the effects of antihypertensive drugs on patients with hypertension. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has also shown that tight blood pressure control can reduce the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[DIURETICS AND DIABETES]
Thiazide diuretics, commonly used to treat hypertension, can have a diabetogenic effect, meaning they can worsen glucose tolerance and increase the risk of developing diabetes. Other diuretics, such as frusemide and furosemide, have also been shown to induce hyperglycemia. Therefore, patients with diabetes should be closely monitored when taking these medications.

----
[STATINS AND DIABETES]
Cholesterol-lowering therapy, particularly with statins, has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials of statins found that cholesterol-lowering therapy reduced the risk of major vascular events in patients with diabetes.

----
[OTHER MEDICATIONS AND DIABETES]
Certain medications, such as niacin and clofibrate, can affect glucose control in patients with diabetes. Niacin, for example, can worsen glucose tolerance and increase the risk of hyperglycemia. On the other hand, some medications, such as metformin and bezafibrate, have been shown to improve glucose control and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.

----
[DRUG INTERACTIONS AND DIABETES]
Some medications can interfere with urine glucose tests or blood glucose measurements, leading to false-negative or false-positive results. Patients with diabetes should be aware of these potential interactions and inform their healthcare providers about all medications they are taking.
----
[INSULIN FUNCTION]
Insulin is a potent anabolic hormone essential for life, and its absence induces a profound catabolic state that affects fat, carbohydrate, and protein stores. Absolute insulin deficiency, such as that characterized by type 1 diabetes, will result in death if left untreated. The normal circulating concentration of insulin is 15-20 mU/L in the fasting state and 60-80 mU/L post-prandially.

----
[DIABETES TREATMENT BEFORE INSULIN]
Before the discovery of insulin, treatment for diabetes was limited and often ineffective, with severe nutritional restriction being one of the most popular therapies. However, this regimen was difficult to follow and did not significantly prolong life expectancy, with death often resulting from either diabetes or starvation. The introduction of insulin revolutionized the treatment of diabetes, saving countless lives and improving the quality of life for people with the condition.

----
[INSULIN TYPES AND ADMINISTRATION]
There are various types of insulin preparations available, including rapid-acting insulin analogs, soluble insulin, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, lente insulins, and long-acting insulin analogs, each with different durations of action. The recommended method of insulin injection involves pinching the skin, injecting at a right angle, and holding the fold for 5-10 seconds before removing the needle. Alternative modes of insulin administration, such as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, can also be effective.

----
[INSULIN REPLACEMENT THERAPY]
The goal of insulin replacement therapy is to reproduce a normal physiologic insulin profile without incurring significant hypoglycemia. Multiple-dose insulin therapy is an appropriate initial approach, consisting of a long-acting insulin preparation administered once or twice a day to meet the basal insulin requirement, with the injection of a short-acting insulin preparation with each meal. This approach can help achieve good glycemic control and minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.
----
[INSULIN DISCOVERY]
The discovery of insulin is attributed to Frederick Grant Banting, who, with the support of John Macleod and Charles Best, isolated the internal secretion of the pancreas and tested its effect on blood sugar in diabetic dogs. This led to the purification of insulin, which was later used in experiments on patients. Banting and Macleod shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1923 for their work. The discovery of insulin was a defining moment in the history of diabetes.

----
[COMMERCIAL INSULIN PRODUCTION]
Commercially available insulin was initially extracted from porcine and bovine pancreata, with a purity of 80-90%. The production process involved acid-ethanol treatment, salting out with sodium chloride, precipitation, and crystallization. However, this insulin was often complicated by immune-mediated side effects, such as lipoatrophy and antibody-mediated insulin resistance, due to contaminants like pancreatic polypeptides and glucagon.

----
[INSULIN PURIFICATION]
The purification of insulin was a crucial step in its development, with contributions from several scientists, including Frederick Sanger, Dorothy Hodgkin, and Rosalyn Yalow, who were awarded Nobel Prizes for their work. The purification process involved various techniques, including X-crystallographic studies and radioimmunoassays, which helped to improve the purity and effectiveness of insulin.

----
[EARLY INSULIN THERAPY]
The introduction of insulin therapy revolutionized the treatment of diabetes, as evident from the significant improvement in patients' condition before and after insulin therapy. The early experiments on patients using purified insulin marked a significant milestone in the history of diabetes treatment, paving the way for modern diabetes care.
----
[INSULIN PRODUCTION METHODS]
Human insulin is produced using three techniques: isolating and purifying it from human cadaveric pancreata, semi-synthesis by converting porcine insulin to human sequence, and recombinant DNA technology. The latter involves inserting the human DNA sequence into a host cell, such as yeast or bacteria, to synthesize the insulin molecule. This method allows for a high purity of 99.5-99.9% insulin. The quality of human insulin preparation achieved with this technique has virtually eliminated problems associated with immune-mediated side effects.

----
[COMPARISON OF HUMAN AND ANIMAL INSULIN]
Studies comparing purified animal insulin with recombinant human insulin have not demonstrated a significant benefit in glycemic control. A meta-analysis of 45 randomized controlled trials found no significant difference between the two therapies. Most studies used highly purified porcine insulin, which is believed to be less immunogenic than bovine insulin. Overall, there is a lack of good studies demonstrating the superiority of human over animal insulin with regard to glycemic control.

----
[ANIMAL INSULIN CHARACTERISTICS]
Animal insulin is derived from porcine and bovine sources, with amino acid structures differing from human insulin by one to three amino acids. The purity of the insulin preparation, rather than the source, appears to influence its immunogenicity. The introduction of additional purification steps in the 1970s resulted in a purer insulin with fewer side effects and better tolerance.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY MILESTONES]
Key milestones in insulin therapy include the isolation of insulin and treatment of the first patient in 1922, the introduction of protamine insulin in 1936, and the development of recombinant DNA human insulin in 1980. Other notable developments include the introduction of insulin pens, monomeric short-acting insulins, and rapid-acting insulin analogs. These advancements have improved the treatment and management of diabetes over the years.
----
[INSULIN DEVELOPMENT HISTORY]
The development of insulin has undergone significant refinements since its introduction, with the addition of protamine and zinc in the 1940s resulting in a more consistent absorption rate and longer-lasting effect. This led to the creation of isophane or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, which became available clinically in 1940. Further developments in the 1950s introduced lente insulins, which prolonged the action of insulin without the need for protamine. 
----
[INSULIN TYPES AND FORMULATIONS]
Various types of insulin have been developed, including rapid and long-acting insulin analogs, as well as soluble and long-acting insulin preparations. The size of insulin crystals can be adjusted to produce different types of insulin, such as ultralente and semilente insulins. A preparation containing a 70:30 ratio of ultralente and semilente insulins, known as lente insulin, was widely used in clinical practice. 
----
[INSULIN ABSORPTION AND ADMINISTRATION]
Insulin molecules tend to associate non-covalently into dimers, tetramers, and hexamers at higher concentrations, and the presence of zinc stabilizes the hexamer association. After injection, fluid is drawn into the injected insulin depot, leading to dilution and dissociation of insulin molecules, which must occur before insulin can cross capillary walls into the blood circulation. Patients are advised to inject soluble insulin 15-20 minutes before a meal to optimize circulating insulin levels. 
----
[RECOMBINANT HUMAN INSULIN]
Recombinant human insulin has become the dominant form of insulin, with less than 7% of global insulin sales being animal insulin. The shift towards recombinant human insulin is likely due to the phasing out of animal insulins by leading manufacturers, although animal insulins remain available and may be cheaper in some parts of the world. 
----
[ANIMAL INSULIN AVAILABILITY AND PRICING]
Although animal insulins are no longer the primary source of insulin, they remain available, with both bovine and porcine-derived insulins still being produced. The pricing of animal insulins varies worldwide, with the cost being comparable to recombinant human insulin in some countries, but significantly cheaper in others, such as the developing world.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION AND FUNCTION]
Insulin secretion can vary significantly within the same individual, depending on factors such as counter-regulatory hormones and the carbohydrate and protein content of a meal. The insulin is secreted into the portal circulation, with about 50% of the insulin removed in the first pass through the liver. Continuous low levels of insulin secretion act to suppress hepatic glucose output, while peripheral tissues such as muscle take up glucose at higher insulin concentrations.

----
[INSULIN REPLACEMENT THERAPY]
The challenge of insulin replacement therapy is to reproduce the physiologic insulin profile without incurring significant risk of hypoglycemia. This requires careful planning and administration of insulin to mimic the natural insulin secretion pattern. The goal is to achieve glycemic control while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia.

----
[RAPID-ACTING INSULIN ANALOGS]
Rapid-acting insulin analogs (RAIs) have been developed to reduce the association between insulin molecules, resulting in faster absorption and a shorter duration of action. Examples of RAIs include insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin glulisine, which act more quickly and have a shorter duration of action than soluble insulin. These analogs have been shown to be safe and effective in controlling post-prandial hyperglycemia and reducing the risk of hypoglycemia.

----
[LONG-ACTING INSULIN ANALOGS]
Long-acting insulin analogs have been developed to provide a more reproducible and slower absorption of insulin, reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. These analogs have a modified primary amino acid sequence that encourages insulin to precipitate following injection into the subcutaneous tissue, resulting in a more predictable absorption profile. However, early studies have failed to show a clear benefit in glycemic control compared to traditional isophane NPH insulins.
----
[INSULIN ADMINISTRATION ROUTES]
Insulin administration can be done through various routes, including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and oral. The subcutaneous route is the most popular due to its relatively reproducible kinetics of absorption and ease of administration. However, other routes may be useful in specific situations, such as intramuscular injection in emergency situations or intraperitoneal administration for implantable insulin pump therapy.

----
[INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION]
Intramuscular injection is more painful and has more rapid absorption than the subcutaneous route, but it can be useful in emergency situations when intravenous access is difficult. Inadvertent intramuscular administration can lead to erratic glucose control and hypoglycemia, especially in slim patients, and can be addressed with the correct choice of insulin needles.

----
[INTRAPERITONEAL INSULIN ADMINISTRATION]
Intraperitoneal insulin administration is absorbed more quickly than the subcutaneous route and has gained interest for use with implantable insulin pump therapy. This route allows for insulin to be absorbed into the portal circulation, reducing the risks of high peripheral insulin levels and potentially contributing to better glucose control and less hypoglycemia.

----
[ORAL INSULIN ADMINISTRATION]
Oral administration of insulin is a potential route that can allow insulin to enter the portal circulation, avoiding high levels of peripheral insulin. Emerging reports suggest that modifying insulin to resist degradation can increase circulating insulin concentrations and decrease blood glucose levels in early phase clinical trials.

----
[SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN ADMINISTRATION TECHNIQUE]
The recommended technique for subcutaneous insulin injection involves pinching the skin to reduce the risk of injecting into muscle, injecting at right angles to the skin, and holding the fold for 5-10 seconds before removing the needle. The use of insulin pens has become increasingly popular due to their ease of use, and various types of pens are available from major insulin manufacturers.
----
[INSULIN ABSORPTION FACTORS]
Insulin absorption can be influenced by various factors, including exercise, temperature, and local inflammation or edema. Exercise can increase blood flow to the skin, resulting in faster insulin uptake, especially when injected near the exercised muscle groups. Temperature also affects insulin absorption, with hot climates or saunas leading to rapid surges in insulin levels, while cooler climates result in slower uptake.

----
[COMPLICATIONS OF INSULIN THERAPY]
The most serious complication of insulin injection is hypoglycemia, which can be a major barrier to insulin initiation and achieving tight glycemic control. Insulin therapy can also lead to excessive weight gain, particularly in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes, which can be mitigated with proper diet and tailored insulin regimens.

----
[INSULIN-RELATED WEIGHT GAIN]
Insulin can restore fat and muscle mass in newly or suboptimally treated insulin-requiring patients, but it can also lead to excessive weight gain. This is a major concern for many patients, especially those who are already overweight, and can be reduced by concomitant dietary advice and tailored insulin regimens.

----
[IMMUNE RESPONSES TO INSULIN]
Immune responses to insulin are rare, but can occur in response to older animal insulins or agents added to insulin preparations. Allergies may develop, resulting in local acute urticarial reactions, which can be treated by switching to alternative insulins or using antihistamines or high-dose steroids in exceptional cases.

----
[INSULIN ANTIBODIES]
Antibodies to exogenous insulin are rare, but can be induced by animal insulin products, and may lead to local allergic reactions or affect the action of short-acting insulins. These effects are often unpredictable and can make insulin therapy more challenging.

----
[INSULIN INJECTION TECHNIQUE]
The choice of needle length and injection technique can affect insulin absorption and comfort. Shorter needles may be associated with a lower risk of intramuscular injection, but can also increase the risk of back-leakage of insulin if the technique is poor. A 6-8 mm needle is usually suitable for non-obese patients using the pinch technique on the abdomen, arm, or legs.

----
[INSULIN STORAGE]
Standard insulin preparations have a shelf life of 4-6 weeks when stored at under 25°C, and can be stored for longer periods in a fridge at 4°C. Proper storage is essential to maintain insulin potency and effectiveness.
----
[INSULIN THERAPY INTRODUCTION]
Insulin injections can induce anxieties in patients, including feelings of personal failure, fears of hypoglycemia, and concerns over weight gain and lifestyle impact. To introduce insulin therapy, starting with one injection a day can be an effective approach, usually added to existing oral therapies rather than as a replacement. This approach is supported by national and international guidelines, which recommend the use of basal insulin with oral therapy as a way of initiating insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY GUIDELINES]
National and international guidelines in the UK, Europe, and the USA recommend the use of basal insulin with oral therapy as a way of initiating insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The initiation of insulin therapy should take place within a structured program, including active insulin dose titration, education, and ongoing support. Guidelines continue to recommend initiation with human NPH insulin or long-acting insulin analogs, depending on the patient's needs and lifestyle.

----
[INSULIN TITRATION AND SUPPORT]
The initiation of insulin therapy should include appropriate education, ongoing support, and the use of blood glucose self-monitoring to help with dose titration to an agreed target. Healthcare professionals should provide support and guidance on diet, avoidance and management of hypoglycemia, and insulin dose adjustment. Algorithms have been developed to assist with insulin dose adjustment, and it is essential to adjust doses appropriately to achieve an agreed target.

----
[INSULIN-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS]
Lipoatrophy, an allergic response seen predominantly with older animal insulins, is rarely seen today. In contrast, lipohypertrophy, an increase in adipose tissue as a trophic response to insulin, is not uncommon and can develop at the site of injection. Insulin antibodies can also affect blood glucose levels and glycemic control, but there is little evidence to substantiate any significant effect outside anecdotal case reports.
----
[INSULIN TITRATION]
To effectively manage blood glucose levels, it is essential to titrate prandial insulin to a glucose target, with the ideal time to test its impact being 90 minutes to 2 hours after a meal. Insulin dosage should not be changed too frequently, ideally no less than every 3 days or no more than twice a week. The patient may adjust the insulin dose based on meal size, although the dose is usually stable from day to day.
----
[BASAL BOLUS REGIMEN]
The basal bolus regimen aims to mimic normal physiologic insulin secretion by providing 24-hour background coverage and a bolus injection at each mealtime. Most patients use long-acting analog insulins, administering the basal injection once a day, while some may require two basal injections 12 hours apart to achieve satisfactory glucose values without hypoglycemia.
----
[INSULIN DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT]
Insulin doses should be adequately titrated to achieve target glucose and HbA1c values. The basal insulin dose is determined by measuring fasting glucose values, and the prandial insulin dose is best determined by 2-hour post-prandial glucose values. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is crucial in the dose titration process, with the ultimate measure of success being the HbA1c value.
----
[COMBINATIONS OF PRANDIAL AND BASAL INSULINS]
In patients with type 2 diabetes, a rising HbA1c with normal fasting glucose values suggests significant post-prandial glucose excursions, requiring the addition of a prandial insulin with the main meal. Alternatively, patients can be switched to a premixed insulin, given twice daily or initially once a day with the main meal, increasing up to three times a day as needed.
----
[BASAL PLUS REGIMEN]
The addition of a fast-acting human insulin or rapid-acting analog insulin before the main meal can be a useful next step in intensification after starting a basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. This approach can help improve glucose control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.
----
[INSULIN MIXTURES]
Insulin mixtures are commonly used by patients with diabetes, with most people using premixed insulin preparations instead of self-mixing fast-acting and long-acting insulins. Premixed insulins are available in various ratios, including 25:75, 30:70, and 50:50, and are typically injected twice a day, before breakfast and the evening meal. The choice of premixed insulin ratio may depend on the individual's needs and the type of diabetes they have.

----
[SELECTING AN INSULIN REGIMEN]
The selection of an insulin regimen is influenced by various factors, including patient choice, and may involve trying different treatment regimens throughout their lives. While clinical trials provide evidence, patient preference plays a significant role in determining the most appropriate regimen. Ultimately, the goal is to find a regimen that provides effective blood glucose control and is manageable for the individual.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES TREATMENT]
Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) require exogenous insulin to provide 24-hour background and mealtime coverage, which can be achieved through a basal-bolus regimen. This approach provides a more physiologic insulin replacement and greater flexibility, but may require more daily insulin injections and frequent self-blood glucose monitoring. The basal-bolus regimen allows for varying mealtime doses to accommodate different daily activities and meal sizes.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES TREATMENT]
In type 2 diabetes (T2DM), insulin initiation and intensification is often a more gradual process, and views differ on the insulin of choice for initiation. Long-acting basal analogs are now recommended as an add-on to existing oral therapy, and have been shown to have low rates of hypoglycemia compared to NPH insulin. However, many patients may require a second insulin injection with a mealtime component within 6-12 months to achieve satisfactory glycemic targets.
----
[INSULIN TYPES AND USAGE]
The use of animal, human, and analog insulins has evolved over time, with each type having its own advantages and disadvantages. While animal insulin is still used, human and analog insulins are more commonly prescribed due to their improved properties. However, analog insulins are generally more expensive and their cost-benefit ratio is still a topic of debate. Ultimately, the choice of insulin type depends on clinical judgment and patient involvement.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND MONITORING]
National and international guidelines recommend glycemic targets based on HbA1c levels, and self-monitoring of blood glucose helps patients achieve these targets by adjusting insulin doses. Patients should test their blood glucose levels at different times, including pre-meal and post-prandial tests, to obtain a 24-hour glucose profile. The goal is to achieve strict glycemic control, with pre-meal blood sugar readings between 4 and 7 mmol/L and post-meal levels between 4 and 10 mmol/L.

----
[INSULIN DOSE ADJUSTMENT]
To achieve glycemic control, insulin doses can be adjusted based on blood glucose test results, with a change of 2 units or 10% of the dose (whichever is greater) being a sensible adjustment for most patients. However, individual specialists may have their own dose adjustment algorithms, and patients with type 2 diabetes may have different targets and testing frequencies. Regular self-monitoring and timely dose adjustments are crucial for effective insulin therapy.

----
[INSULIN INITIATION AND EDUCATION]
A good insulin initiation program is essential for successful insulin therapy, and should involve a qualified diabetes nurse specialist and a structured training program. Insulin initiation involves more than just teaching patients how to use a needle and syringe, and requires ongoing support and education to help patients manage their condition effectively. A 24-hour emergency contact number should also be provided for any urgent problems that may arise.
----
[INSULIN THERAPY OPTIONS]
Insulin therapy can be administered through various methods, including insulin pumps, multiple daily injections, and implantable pumps. Research has compared the effectiveness of rapid-acting insulin analogues, long-acting insulin analogues, and NPH insulin in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The choice of insulin therapy depends on individual patient needs and preferences.

----
[INSULIN PHARMACOKINETICS]

Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of administration method depends on patient factors, such as lifestyle and preferences. Proper insulin administration techniques are essential to ensure effective glucose control.

----
[INSULIN DEGRADATION AND METABOLISM]
Insulin degradation and metabolism are critical processes that affect the duration and intensity of insulin action. Research has investigated the mechanisms of insulin degradation, including the role of the kidney in insulin metabolism and excretion. Understanding insulin degradation and metabolism can help healthcare providers optimize insulin therapy and improve patient outcomes.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Effective diabetes management requires a comprehensive approach that includes insulin therapy, lifestyle modifications, and ongoing monitoring. Studies have demonstrated the importance of intensive conventional insulin therapy in achieving metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, research has explored the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and coronary heart disease, highlighting the need for careful management of insulin therapy.
----
[INSULIN TREATMENT GUIDELINES]
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has published medical guidelines for the management of diabetes mellitus, which include recommendations for insulin treatment. The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions has also published guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes, including the use of insulin. These guidelines provide a framework for healthcare professionals to follow when treating patients with diabetes.

----
[INSULIN TYPES AND FORMULATIONS]
There are several types of insulin, including human insulin and insulin analogues, which have different pharmacokinetic properties. Insulin glargine, for example, is a long-acting insulin analogue that can be used once daily, while insulin lispro is a short-acting insulin analogue that can be used before meals. Biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 is a premixed insulin that combines a rapid-acting and an intermediate-acting component.

----
[CLINICAL TRIALS AND STUDIES]
Several clinical trials have compared the efficacy and safety of different insulin regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes. The 4-T Study, for example, compared the addition of biphasic, prandial, or basal insulin to oral therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The INITIATE Study compared the initiation of insulin therapy with biphasic or basal insulin analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN PHARMACOKINETICS]
The pharmacokinetics of insulin, including its absorption, distribution, and elimination, are important factors to consider when selecting an insulin regimen. The absorption of insulin can be affected by factors such as the site of injection and the presence of other medications. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of insulin can help healthcare professionals optimize insulin therapy for their patients.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS]
The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions has published recommendations for the diagnosis and management of type 1 diabetes in adults, which include guidance on insulin therapy. The ACCORD and ADVANCE trials have also provided evidence on the benefits and risks of intensive glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, which can inform insulin treatment decisions.
----
[INSULIN ADMINISTRATION TECHNOLOGIES]
New technologies for insulin administration and glucose monitoring, such as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps and continuous glucose monitors, can be effective tools for improving metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. These technologies provide increased lifestyle flexibility and can reduce the risk for hypoglycemia. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring devices offer detailed information on glucose patterns and trends, and alarms for both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

----
[CONTINUOUS SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN INFUSION PUMPS]
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pumps have been in use for over 30 years and consist of an insulin reservoir and a delivery catheter that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The use of CSII pumps has grown in recent years due to their association with reduced risk for hypoglycemia and improvements in reliability and usability. CSII pumps can provide a comprehensive and flexible approach to insulin administration.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL WITH INSULIN PUMPS]
Several published meta-analyses have examined the role of CSII pumps in intensifying glycemic control, indicating that CSII use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with 0.4-0.5% lower HbA1c than multiple daily injection therapy. The improvements in HbA1c with pump therapy appear to be greater in individuals with poorer glycemic control. CSII pumps have been shown to be superior to multiple daily injection regimens using both older and newer insulin analogs.

----
[REAL-TIME CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING]
Real-time continuous glucose monitoring devices provide detailed information on glucose patterns and trends, and alarms that are triggered by both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. These devices can be an effective tool for improving metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, and randomized trials have indicated that their use can lead to a reduction in HbA1c without an associated increase in hypoglycemia. This technology has the potential to significantly improve diabetes management and patient outcomes.
----
[INSULIN PUMP THERAPY BENEFITS]
Insulin pump therapy, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), can be an effective tool for reducing glycemic variability and the risk of hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Clinical guidelines recommend considering pump therapy for individuals with T1DM who have suboptimal glycemic control and problematic hypoglycemia. Pump therapy has been shown to reduce the rate of severe hypoglycemia, especially in individuals with higher rates of severe hypoglycemia and those with longer duration of diabetes.

----
[INSULIN PUMP THERAPY EFFECTIVENESS]
The effectiveness of insulin pump therapy in reducing severe hypoglycemia has been studied in several meta-analyses, with some showing a significant reduction in severe hypoglycemia and others showing no significant difference. A meta-analysis by Pickup and Sutton found a 2.9-fold reduction in severe hypoglycemia during CSII compared to multiple daily injections (MDI), while another meta-analysis commissioned by the Endocrine Society found no significant reduction in severe or nocturnal hypoglycemia.

----
[INSULIN PUMP THERAPY FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The evidence for the benefits of insulin pump therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is limited, with some studies showing similar HbA1c changes with both pump therapy and MDI. However, a small-scale cross-over study in obese subjects with T2DM and insulin resistance found a significant benefit of pump therapy.

----
[IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR PUMP THERAPY]
Before initiating pump therapy, it is essential to rule out intentional insulin omission, which can be a cause of poorly controlled diabetes, especially in young women. Patients with a history of severe hypoglycemic reactions or hypoglycemia unawareness should be considered for a trial of insulin pump therapy, and clinicians should be cautious of the potential for insulin non-adherence in patients with a history of intentional insulin omission.
----
[INFUSION SITE ISSUES]
Infusion site issues, such as scarring, lipohypertrophy, and lipoatrophy, can occur in pump users and may cause unexplained glucose fluctuations. Regular examination of infusion sites is recommended to identify these issues. Solutions to infusion site issues include changing to metal needle infusion sets or using plastic sets with a shorter cannula or a broader base of attachment to the skin.

----
[INFUSION CATHETER PROBLEMS]
Infusion catheter kinking or dislodgement can occur, especially with activity or perspiration, and is more common with certain types of plastic catheters. Using catheters with a shorter cannula or those that insert obliquely can help prevent kinking. Changing to metal needle infusion sets can also be a solution.

----
[PUMP MAINTENANCE]
Failure to change the pump reservoir and infusion system regularly can lead to elevated and erratic glucose levels. Regularly reviewing pump downloads can help identify issues, such as missed meal boluses or incorrect basal to bolus insulin ratios. Checking priming history and bolus history can also help assess how frequently the infusion system is being changed.

----
[PUMP DOWNLOAD REVIEW]
Reviewing pump downloads can be helpful in detecting possible issues, such as missed meal boluses or incorrect basal to bolus insulin ratios. A high percentage of basal insulin in patients with frequent hyperglycemia may indicate that bolus doses are frequently being missed, while a high percentage of basal insulin in patients with frequent hypoglycemia may indicate that high basal rates are contributing to hypoglycemia.

----
[INSULIN INSTABILITY]
Insulin instability in the pump infusion system can manifest as increases in glucose levels in the period preceding infusion set changes or even precipitation in the infusion system. This issue can be caused by poor filling technique or other factors.

These devices measure the glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid every 1-5 minutes, providing real-time glucose monitoring. Examples of approved CGM devices include the Abbott Freestyle Navigator, DexCom Seven, and Medtronic Guardian/Paradigm system.

----
[INSULIN DURATION OF ACTION SETTINGS]
The duration of action setting in bolus calculator software is typically based on a clinical assessment of the patient's hypoglycemia risk and the need for tight glycemic control. For individuals with frequent hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness, the duration of action should be set to 5 hours or longer, while for pregnant women or those trying to conceive, it is often set to 2-3 hours. Incorrect settings can lead to over- or under-dosing of insulin, affecting glycemic control.

----
[REAL-TIME CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING BENEFITS]
Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) devices can detect rapid spikes in glucose levels after meals, which may not be detected by intermittent fingerstick blood glucose monitoring. This information can be used to make treatment recommendations, such as changing to slower-absorbing carbohydrates or injecting bolus insulin earlier before meals. RT-CGM devices can provide valuable insights into glucose patterns and help optimize glycemic control.

----
[GLUCOSE MONITORING REPORTS]
Glucose monitoring reports, such as the modal day report, can provide a detailed overview of a patient's glucose levels over a specific time period. These reports can help identify patterns and trends in glucose levels, allowing healthcare providers to make informed treatment decisions and adjust insulin regimens accordingly. The reports can also help patients understand their glucose levels and make lifestyle changes to improve their glycemic control.

[CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS]
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to be effective in reducing HbA1c levels in patients with type 1 diabetes. Studies have demonstrated that CGM can lead to a reduction in both hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic excursions, with more time spent in the target glucose range. The GuardControl trial, which used the Medtronic Guardian, found a 1.0% reduction in HbA1c at 3-month follow-up in the CGM group compared to 0.4% in the control group.

----
[REAL-TIME CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING TRIALS]
The Star 1 trial and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) sponsored CGM trial are two large-scale multicenter randomized controlled trials that have investigated the effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM). The Star 1 trial found a similar reduction in HbA1c in both the RT-CGM and control groups, while the JDRF trial found that 50% of subjects in the CGM group had HbA1c reductions of ≥1% compared to 15% in the control group.

----
[REAL-TIME CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING DEVICE FUNCTIONALITY]
RT-CGM devices provide detailed information about glucose patterns, the rate and direction of change in glucose levels, and adjustable alarms for both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Although these devices do not have regulatory approval for use as stand-alone devices, they can be used in conjunction with capillary blood glucose measurements to provide additional insights into glucose control.

----
[CLINICAL EFFICACY OF REAL-TIME CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING]
The clinical efficacy of RT-CGM has been demonstrated in several studies, which have shown that it can lead to improved glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. The use of RT-CGM has been associated with a reduction in HbA1c levels and an increase in the amount of time spent in the target glucose range.
----
[REAL-TIME CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING BENEFITS]
Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) has been shown to improve glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemic events in patients with type 1 diabetes. Studies have demonstrated that RT-CGM can lead to a significant reduction in HbA1c levels and a decrease in the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events. This technology offers promise for people with type 1 diabetes, particularly when used in conjunction with advanced diabetes self-management skills.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF PATIENT ENGAGEMENT AND EDUCATION]
The successful use of RT-CGM requires patients to have a high level of engagement in their diabetes self-care and advanced diabetes self-management skills. Patients need to be trained on how to use the technology effectively, including calibration and interpretation of results. The mean number of daily capillary blood glucose measurements performed by patients using RT-CGM is typically high, indicating a strong commitment to self-care.
----
[PHYSIOLOGIC LAG BETWEEN BLOOD AND INTERSTITIAL GLUCOSE]
There is a lag in the equilibration of glucose levels between capillary blood and interstitial fluid, which has important practical implications for RT-CGM. Increases or decreases in glucose concentration will first be apparent in the blood, followed by the interstitial fluid. To optimize sensor accuracy, calibrations should be performed when glucose levels are relatively stable, and there is steady-state equilibration between glucose concentrations in the blood and interstitial fluid.
----
[PRACTICAL ISSUES WITH RT-CGM USE]
The use of RT-CGM is not without challenges, including the potential for failure to respond to alarm warnings of hypoglycemia, dose stacking due to multiple insulin boluses, and "blind boluses" based on sensor readings without confirmatory fingerstick capillary blood glucose measurements. These issues highlight the need for comprehensive patient education and training on the use of RT-CGM technology.
----
[CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS]
Clinical trials, such as the JDRF CGM trial, have demonstrated the benefits of RT-CGM in improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of severe hypoglycemic events. The trial enrolled 451 patients with type 1 diabetes and used three different CGM devices, with assignment based on patient preference and investigator guidance. The results of the trial showed a significant reduction in HbA1c levels and a decrease in the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events in the RT-CGM group compared to the control group.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA TREATMENT]
During the recovery from hypoglycemia, the increase in interstitial glucose will often lag behind the blood glucose, and patients should be instructed to perform fingerstick glucose measurements to assess the response to treatment accurately. This is because relying on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices alone may lead to incorrect assumptions about the need for additional carbohydrate consumption. Patients should be aware of this lag to ensure proper treatment and avoid overconsumption of carbohydrates.

----
[SETTING GLUCOSE ALARMS]
The alarms for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia on CGM devices are an important feature, but the adjustment of alarm thresholds requires individualization based on specific clinical considerations. If alarm thresholds are set too low, there may be increased sensitivity for detection, but also frequent false alarms that can lead to "alarm fatigue." The adjustment of alarm thresholds is a stepwise process, involving initial threshold setting and optimization over time based on retrospective review of continuous glucose tracings.

----
[ALARM THRESHOLD GUIDELINES]
For patients with hypoglycemia unawareness or a history of severe hypoglycemic reactions, the low glucose alarm threshold should be set at 4.5 mmol/L (80 mg/dL) or higher. For individuals without a history of problematic hypoglycemia, initial glucose thresholds can be set at 3-3.5 mmol/L (55-60 mg/dL) and ≥14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL), with adjustments made over time to tighten glycemic control. Clinicians should regularly review alarm settings with patients to ensure optimal detection and minimize false alarms.

----
[CGM DEVICE CALIBRATION]
The first generation CGM devices require calibration at least 4 times per day for optimal accuracy. Additionally, patients should be instructed to perform fingerstick blood glucose measurements before driving if the sensor glucose reading is normal but the trend graph or rate-of-change arrows indicate a declining glucose level. This is crucial to ensure safe driving practices and prevent hypoglycemic episodes.
----
[INSULIN ADMINISTRATION TECHNOLOGIES]
New technologies for insulin administration and glucose monitoring are being developed to improve diabetes care. A "closed-loop system" integrates a continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump with an automated algorithm to control insulin delivery, essentially functioning as an artificial pancreas. This system aims to remove the patient from the decision loop and reduce the risk of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic episodes. The development of a fail-safe algorithm is a major challenge for the fully automated closed-loop system.

----
[CHALLENGES IN CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEMS]
Several technical obstacles need to be addressed in developing a closed-loop system, including the development of accurate and reliable glucose sensors with minimal calibration drift and limited potential mechanisms for sensor failure. Physiologic lag can also be problematic during times of rapid rates of change in blood glucose levels, such as during meals or exercise. Therefore, developing a sensor with a short lag time is crucial for the success of closed-loop systems.

----
[RISK OF HYPOGLYCEMIA WITH CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING]
While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices can help minimize hypoglycemia, some patients may overreact to post-prandial glucose spikes and take excessive doses of insulin, leading to an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Patients need to factor in the amount of residual insulin on board (IOB) from the previous bolus before taking additional insulin to treat post-prandial hyperglycemia. Newer pumps with bolus calculator software can guide patients in making appropriate dose adjustments.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC INDEX IN MEAL PLANNING]
The glycemic index of carbohydrates in a meal is an important factor to consider when deciding whether additional boluses are required to treat post-prandial hyperglycemia. High glycemic index carbohydrates can lead to an early spike in glucose levels, and correction boluses taken within 2-3 hours after the meal can result in hypoglycemia. Patients should be educated on the importance of considering the glycemic index when planning their meals and adjusting their insulin doses accordingly.

----
[ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS DEVELOPMENT]
The development of the first generations of an artificial pancreas is underway, with several studies demonstrating that glycemic control can be achieved with an automated closed-loop system in investigational and controlled hospital settings. Medtronic MiniMed has developed an external physiologic CGM alarm, and the first prototype closed-loop systems that can deliver glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia are being evaluated. These advancements hold promise for improving diabetes care and management.
----
[CONTINUOUS SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN INFUSION]
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is an approach to achieving normoglycaemia, where insulin is administered through a portable infusion pump. This method has been compared to intensive insulin injections in patients with type 1 diabetes, with meta-analyses showing its effectiveness in glycaemic control. CSII has been found to reduce plasma glucose levels in juvenile diabetes and improve glucose homeostasis.

----
[INSULIN PUMP THERAPY]
Insulin pump therapy involves the use of a portable infusion pump to administer insulin, and has been shown to have a positive effect on glucose homeostasis, metabolites, hormones, and quality of life. However, it is not without complications, with reports of acute complications associated with insulin infusion pump therapy. The American Diabetes Association and other organizations have published guidelines and position papers on the use of insulin pumps.

----
[COMPARISON TO MULTIPLE DAILY INJECTIONS]
Studies have compared CSII to multiple daily insulin injections, with results showing that CSII can be more effective in achieving glycaemic control, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes. The impact of baseline A1c levels on the effectiveness of CSII versus multiple daily injections has also been investigated, highlighting the importance of blood glucose variability in determining treatment outcomes.

----

Insulin pumps can provide more precise and flexible insulin delivery, which can help to improve glucose control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in pediatric patients. Studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of insulin pump therapy in pediatric patients, with improvements in glycemic control and quality of life.

----
[POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE CONTROL]
Postprandial glucose control is a critical aspect of diabetes management, with studies demonstrating the importance of optimal insulin dosing and timing to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia. The use of bolus calculators and dual-wave bolus features in insulin pumps can help to improve postprandial glucose control, particularly after meals with high carbohydrate and fat content. Research has shown that optimal insulin pump dosing and postprandial glucose monitoring can help to reduce the risk of hyperglycemia and improve overall glycemic control.

----
[INSULIN PUMP FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY]
Insulin pumps with advanced features, such as bolus calculators and dual-wave bolus functionality, can help to improve postprandial glucose control and reduce the risk of hyperglycemia. Studies have compared the effectiveness of different insulin pump features and functionalities, with results demonstrating the benefits of advanced features in improving glycemic control. The use of smart pumping techniques and bolus calculators can help to optimize insulin dosing and improve overall diabetes management.
----
[CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING]
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a valuable tool for diabetes management, allowing for real-time tracking of glucose levels. Studies have shown that CGM can be effective in improving glucose control, particularly when used in conjunction with insulin therapy. The use of CGM has been evaluated in various studies, including those using the FreeStyle Navigator and other devices.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY AND CGM]
Insulin therapy can be optimized using CGM data, allowing for more precise dosing and improved glucose control. Automated insulin delivery systems, such as closed-loop systems, are being developed and tested, with promising results in clinical trials. These systems use CGM data to automatically adjust insulin doses, potentially improving outcomes for individuals with type 1 diabetes.

----
[INHALED INSULIN THERAPY]
Inhaled insulin therapy has been evaluated as an alternative to subcutaneous insulin injections, with studies showing mixed results. While some studies have reported efficacy and safety comparable to subcutaneous insulin, others have raised concerns about the impact of smoking on inhaled insulin absorption. Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of inhaled insulin therapy.

----
[PATIENT EDUCATION AND FEARS]
Patients with diabetes may have fears and anxieties about insulin therapy, which can impact their willingness to start or adhere to treatment. Injection-related anxiety is a common concern, and healthcare providers should address these fears through education and support. Patient education and counseling can help alleviate concerns and improve outcomes for individuals with diabetes.

----
[CGM ACCURACY AND EFFICACY]
The accuracy and efficacy of CGM systems have been evaluated in several studies, with varying results. Some studies have reported high accuracy and efficacy, while others have identified limitations and areas for improvement. Further research is needed to optimize CGM technology and ensure that it is reliable and effective for diabetes management.
----
[INSULIN ADMINISTRATION TECHNOLOGIES]
New technologies have been developed for insulin administration, including the use of inhalation routes, such as Technosphere/Insulin, which allows for effective delivery of human insulin via the pulmonary route. This approach has been studied in several clinical trials, including one published in Diabetes Technol Ther in 2002. These technologies aim to improve the management of diabetes, particularly for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not well-controlled with oral agents.

----
[INHALED INSULIN PHARMACOKINETICS]
The pharmacokinetics of inhaled human insulin, such as Exubera, have been studied in relation to factors like passive cigarette smoke exposure. Research published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in 2008 found that acute passive cigarette smoke exposure affects the pharmacokinetics of inhaled human insulin. This highlights the importance of considering environmental factors when using inhaled insulin therapies.

----
[CLINICAL TRIALS FOR INHALED INSULIN]
Clinical trials have compared the efficacy and safety of Technosphere inhaled insulin with placebo in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes patients. A study published in 2008 found that Technosphere inhaled insulin was effective and safe in this patient population. These findings suggest that inhaled insulin may be a viable treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not well-controlled with oral agents.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Glycemic control is a fundamental part of managing type 2 diabetes mellitus, and adequate control is necessary to address acute symptoms and prevent or reduce the severity of chronic complications. Treating type 2 diabetes is complicated by the progressive natural history of the disease, including insulin resistance and a decline in β-cell function. Care plans and treatment programs should be tailored to fit the patient's circumstances, with lifestyle management and drug treatment adjusted accordingly.

----
[INITIAL DRUG THERAPY]
The biguanide metformin is often selected as the initial oral antidiabetic drug therapy, as it counters insulin resistance and lowers blood glucose through several mechanisms. Metformin does not stimulate insulin secretion, carries a low risk of hypoglycemia, and does not cause weight gain, making it a suitable choice for many patients. However, gastrointestinal side effects and the risk of lactic acidosis in patients with significant renal insufficiency or liver disease limit its use.

----
[SULFONYLUREAS]
Sulfonylureas, such as gliclazide and glimepiride, act on the pancreatic β-cells to stimulate insulin secretion, and their efficacy depends on adequate remaining β-cell function. However, hypoglycemia is a serious adverse effect, particularly with longer-acting sulfonylureas and in the elderly. Caution is warranted in patients with hepatic and/or renal insufficiency, and interactions with other protein-bound drugs can occur.

----
[MEGLITINIDES]
Meglitinides, such as repaglinide and nateglinide, are rapid and short-acting insulin secretagogues taken before meals to stimulate insulin secretion. They are designed to control postprandial glucose levels and are often used in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. However, their use may be limited by their potential to cause hypoglycemia and other adverse effects.
----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes typically involves defects in insulin secretion and insulin action, with contributing factors including obesity, abnormalities in glucagon secretion, and cellular disturbances in nutrient metabolism. These factors can lead to glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, which participate in the disease process as both causes and consequences. An ideal therapeutic approach would address these basic endocrine defects. Effective management of the disease requires a comprehensive understanding of its underlying pathophysiology.

----
[AIMS OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
The primary aims of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes are to prevent acute symptoms of hyperglycemia, prevent acute and chronic complications, and reduce the severity of microvascular and macrovascular complications. This can be achieved by maintaining optimal HbA1c levels, which is a key indicator of glycemic control. The goals of glycemic control are crucial in managing the disease and preventing its associated complications.

----
[ORAL ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
Oral antidiabetic agents, such as gliptins and α-glucosidase inhibitors, play a crucial role in managing type 2 diabetes. Gliptins, including sitagliptin and vildagliptin, act as prandial insulin secretagogues, while α-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, slow the digestion of carbohydrates, reducing post-prandial glucose excursions. These agents can be used in combination with other therapies, such as metformin, and are often weight-neutral with a low risk of hypoglycemia.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
In advanced stages of type 2 diabetes, β-cell function may be severely compromised, necessitating the initiation of insulin therapy. Insulin therapy can be used in conjunction with oral agents, where appropriate, to achieve optimal glycemic control. This approach can help prevent and manage the complications associated with type 2 diabetes, particularly in patients with severely impaired β-cell function.
----
[INTENSIVE THERAPY BENEFITS]
Intensive therapy in diabetes care has been associated with a 12% reduction in overall diabetes-related endpoints and a 25% reduction in microvascular endpoints. The benefits of intensive therapy continue to accrue until glucose levels are returned to the normal range. Early intensive glycemic control confers an extended reduction in complications, even when control deteriorates at later stages in the disease process. This is known as the glycemic "legacy" effect.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL GUIDELINES]
Guidelines for glycemic control recommend safely returning glycemias as close to normal as practicable, avoiding hypoglycemia, minimizing potential drug interactions, and observing other necessary cautions and contraindications. An individualized approach is recommended, taking into account factors such as age, co-morbidity, and responsiveness to therapy. Current treatment algorithms provide a framework for initiating and intensifying therapy, but clinical judgment should be applied to harmonize this with patient circumstances.

----
[COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT]
Management of hyperglycemia should always be part of a comprehensive management program to address coexistent disease and modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Diet, exercise, and other lifestyle measures should be introduced at diagnosis and reinforced at every appropriate opportunity thereafter. These measures can provide valuable blood glucose lowering efficacy and may initially enable the desired glycemic target to be achieved.

----
[LIFESTYLE MEASURES AND PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY]
Lifestyle measures such as diet and exercise can provide valuable blood glucose lowering efficacy, but the progressive natural history of the disease dictates that the majority of patients will later require pharmacologic therapy. Pharmacologic therapy should be introduced promptly if the glycemic target is not met or not maintained, even when lifestyle advice is successfully implemented.
----
[ORAL ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
The main classes of oral antidiabetic drugs include biguanides, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, gliptins, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, each with distinct modes of action to lower glucose levels. These agents exert their effects on various tissues, including the liver, pancreas, muscle, and adipose tissue. The choice of oral antidiabetic agent depends on several factors, including the patient's individual needs and the potential risks and benefits associated with each class of medication.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Achieving adequate glycemic control is crucial in managing type 2 diabetes, with a focus on addressing both fasting and post-prandial hyperglycemia. The treatment of obesity can also improve glycemic control, and preserving beta-cell function is essential for maintaining long-term glycemic control. Insulin resistance is often established at the time of diagnosis and does not typically progress with disease duration, but addressing insulin resistance remains a valuable therapeutic strategy due to its link with cardiovascular risk.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND BETA-CELL FUNCTION]
Insulin resistance is usually well-established by the time of diagnosis, and the ongoing deterioration in glycemic control is largely attributed to a progressive decline in beta-cell function. Preserving beta-cell function and mass is critical for maintaining long-term glycemic control, and the introduction of insulin therapy should not be delayed if beta-cell function deteriorates beyond the capacity of oral agents to provide adequate control.

----
[TREATMENT STRATEGY]
The treatment of type 2 diabetes involves a comprehensive approach that considers the patient's individual needs, the potential risks and benefits of various medications, and the importance of lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise. The choice of oral antidiabetic agent and the timing of insulin therapy initiation are critical decisions that require careful consideration of the patient's overall health and treatment goals.
----
[ORAL ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS]
Oral antidiabetic agents have limited experience in children and adolescents, but metformin has been used safely in controlled pediatric practice from 10 years of age. Sulfonylureas have been used in pediatric presentations of certain forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). In women of childbearing age, treatment with oral antidiabetic agents carries the risk of unplanned pregnancy. 
----
[DIABETES TREATMENT IN PREGNANCY]
Insulin remains the preferred antidiabetic medication in pregnancy due to its substantial evidence base for safety and flexibility. Metformin has been shown to reduce miscarriage and gestational diabetes when used judiciously. However, thiazolidinediones and gliptins are not recommended during pregnancy and lactation due to a lack of evidence.
----
[DIABETES TREATMENT IN THE ELDERLY]
Elderly patients are more vulnerable to the cautions and contraindications of glucose-lowering drugs and require more frequent monitoring. Hypoglycemia is a particular concern in this age group, and several common medications can impair glycemic control, such as glucocorticoids and certain antipsychotics.
----
[ORAL ANTIDIABETIC TREATMENTS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Table 29.4 summarizes the general features of oral antidiabetic treatments for type 2 diabetes, including their effects on HbA1c, body weight, lipids, and blood pressure, as well as their tolerability, safety, and cautions. The table includes information on metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, gliptins, and α-glucosidase inhibitors.
----
[INTERACTIONS WITH GLUCOSE-LOWERING DRUGS]
Several common medications can interact with glucose-lowering drugs, either by impairing glycemic control or having their own minor glucose-lowering effect. Table 29.5 summarizes the most frequent interactions with glucose-lowering drugs.
----
[DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH ORAL ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
Oral antidiabetic agents can interact with other medications, affecting their glucose-lowering effects. For example, minor insulin releasers like aspirin can increase glucose lowering, while agents that impair insulin action, such as glucocorticoids, can decrease glucose lowering. Additionally, certain medications like cimetidine and furosemide can interact with metformin, affecting its efficacy. These interactions can have significant implications for diabetes management.

----
[METFORMIN HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT]
Metformin, a biguanide, was introduced in the late 1950s and has become the most prescribed antidiabetic agent worldwide. It was introduced in the USA in 1995 and has a long history of use, with other biguanides like phenformin and buformin being withdrawn due to adverse effects. Metformin has a range of actions that counter insulin resistance and lower blood glucose, making it a crucial medication for diabetes management.

----
[MODE OF ACTION OF METFORMIN]
Metformin exerts several actions that counter insulin resistance and lower blood glucose, including decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing peripheral glucose uptake. It also offers protection against vascular complications independently of its antihyperglycemic effect. Metformin's effects on insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia make it a valuable medication for managing type 2 diabetes and reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications.

----
[METFORMIN'S EFFECTS ON METABOLIC AND VASCULAR PARAMETERS]
Metformin has been shown to have various beneficial effects on metabolic and vascular parameters, including decreasing hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia. It also has modest benefits on dyslipidemia, blood pressure, and pro-coagulant state, and may decrease the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. These effects make metformin a crucial component of diabetes management and cardiovascular risk reduction.
----
[MECHANISMS OF METFORMIN]
Metformin exerts insulin-dependent and independent effects on glucose metabolism, improving insulin sensitivity via effects on insulin receptor signaling and post-receptor signaling pathways. It also influences cellular nutrient metabolism and energy production independently of insulin via activation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Metformin's glucose-lowering efficacy requires the presence of at least some insulin, as it does not mimic or activate the genomic effects of insulin.

----
[GLUCOSE-LOWERING EFFECTS OF METFORMIN]
Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production by increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity and decreasing hepatic extraction of gluconeogenic substrates such as lactate. It also decreases hepatic glycogenolysis and enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by increasing translocation of insulin-sensitive glucose transporters (GLUT-4) into the cell membrane. Additionally, metformin can suppress the oxidation of fatty acids and may reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

----
[PHARMACOKINETICS OF METFORMIN]
Metformin is rapidly but incompletely absorbed, shows little binding to plasma proteins, and is not metabolized, making it less likely to interfere with co-administered drugs. It is widely distributed at concentrations similar to plasma and is eliminated in the urine, mostly within 12 hours, with a plasma half-life of about 6 hours. However, metformin is contraindicated for patients with significant impairment of glomerular filtration due to its reliance on renal clearance.

----
[CONTRAINDICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS]
Metformin is contraindicated for patients with significant impairment of glomerular filtration, and cimetidine is the only drug known to compete for clearance sufficiently to cause a clinically significant interaction. Patients with renal impairment should use metformin with caution, and dosage adjustments may be necessary to avoid adverse effects.
----
[METFORMIN EFFICACY]
Metformin is an effective oral antidiabetic agent that reduces fasting plasma glucose by 2-4 mmol/L and HbA1c by approximately 1-2% when used as monotherapy. This effect is largely independent of body weight, age, and duration of diabetes, provided that some β-cell function is still present. Metformin carries minimal risk of significant hypoglycemia or weight gain when used as monotherapy.

----
[METFORMIN BENEFITS]
Metformin therapy has been observed to improve the blood lipid profile, with reductions in triglycerides, fatty acids, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These effects appear to be independent of the antihyperglycemic effect and may help improve insulin sensitivity. Additionally, metformin has been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction by 39% in overweight patients.

----
[METFORMIN CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with significant renal impairment, such as serum creatinine > 130 μmol/L or creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min. Other contraindications include significant cardiac or respiratory insufficiency, conditions predisposing to hypoxia or reduced tissue perfusion, significant liver disease, alcohol abuse, or a history of metabolic acidosis. When adding metformin to insulin therapy, a reduction in insulin dosage is often required.

----
[METFORMIN COMBINATION THERAPY]
The combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea may initially increase cardiovascular mortality, but evidence from large databases has been reassuring. Recent results from the UKPDS post-trial follow-up showed that the cardiovascular benefits of metformin were maintained. When metformin is added to insulin therapy, a reduction in insulin dosage is often required, and careful consideration should be given to patients with impaired renal function.
----
[DIABETES MEDICATION - METFORMIN]
Metformin is a medication that should be stopped immediately in cases of suspected or proven lactic acidosis, regardless of cause. Lactic acidosis is characterized by a raised blood lactate concentration, decreased arterial pH, and/or bicarbonate concentration with an increased anion gap. Presenting symptoms are generally non-specific, but often include hyperventilation, malaise, and abdominal discomfort. Treatment should be commenced promptly without waiting to determine whether metformin is a cause.

----
[DIABETES MEDICATION - SULFONYLUREAS]
Sulfonylureas have been used extensively as insulin secretagogues for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) since their introduction in the 1950s. They were developed as structural variants of sulfonamides after the latter were reported to cause hypoglycemia. Early sulfonylureas have been largely superseded by more potent "second-generation" sulfonylureas, such as glibenclamide, gliclazide, glipizide, and glimepiride.

----
[DIABETES MEDICATION - METFORMIN SIDE EFFECTS]
The main tolerability issue with metformin is abdominal discomfort and other gastrointestinal adverse effects, including diarrhea. These are often transient and can be ameliorated by taking the drug with meals and titrating the dose slowly. The most serious adverse event associated with metformin is lactic acidosis, which is rare but about half of cases are fatal.

----
[DIABETES PREVENTION - METFORMIN]
Metformin has been found to reduce the incidence of new cases of diabetes in overweight and obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance by 33%, compared with a reduced risk of 58% using an intensive regimen of diet and exercise. The preventive effect of metformin was most evident amongst younger, more obese individuals.
----
[MECHANISM OF SULFONYLUREAS]
Sulfonylureas act directly on the β-cells of the islets of Langerhans to stimulate insulin secretion by binding to the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels. This leads to membrane depolarization, opening of calcium channels, and activation of calcium-dependent signaling proteins that control insulin exocytosis. As a result, preformed insulin granules are released, followed by a protracted period of insulin release.

----
[PHARMACOKINETICS OF SULFONYLUREAS]
Sulfonylureas vary in their pharmacokinetic properties, which affects their clinical suitability for different patients. They are generally well absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration in 2-4 hours, and are highly bound to plasma proteins, which can lead to interactions with other medications.

----
[EFFECTS OF SULFONYLUREAS ON GLUCOSE LEVELS]
Sulfonylureas can stimulate insulin release even when glucose concentrations are below the normal threshold, leading to hypoglycemia due to insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production. Additionally, sulfonylureas may exert minor glucose-lowering effects independently of increased insulin secretion, including reducing glucagon concentrations and increasing peripheral glucose transport.

----
[CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF SULFONYLUREAS]
The effects of sulfonylureas on glucose levels and insulin secretion make them a useful treatment option for managing diabetes. However, their potential to cause hypoglycemia and interact with other medications must be carefully considered in clinical practice.
----
[SULFONYLUREAS OVERVIEW]
Sulfonylureas are a class of medications used to treat diabetes, with various agents having different dose ranges, durations of action, and metabolites. They are metabolized in the liver and eliminated through the bile and urine. New patients are not usually started on first-generation sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and chlorpropamide. Glibenclamide is also known as glyburide in some countries.

----
[SULFONYLUREAS FORMULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION]
The formulation of some sulfonylureas has been altered to modify the duration of action, allowing for once-daily dosing. Examples include a micronized formulation of glibenclamide, a longer-acting formulation of glipizide, and a modified release formulation of gliclazide. These formulations can reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia and provide similar efficacy to unmodified versions.

----
[SULFONYLUREAS INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Sulfonylureas are widely used as monotherapy and in combination with other antidiabetic agents, such as metformin, thiazolidinediones, and incretin or DPP-4 inhibitors. They can also be used with insulin, but the combination increases the risk of hypoglycemia. The additive efficacy of sulfonylureas with other agents depends on their modes of action, and careful consideration is needed to avoid unnecessary combinations.

----
[SULFONYLUREAS AND INSULIN THERAPY]
The pharmacologic theory behind adding a sulfonylurea to insulin therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes is to stimulate endogenous insulin delivery to the liver, reducing hepatic glucose production during meal digestion. Daytime sulfonylurea is sometimes given with bedtime insulin, which can substantially reduce the required insulin dose. Present guidelines favor sulfonylureas as alternative first-line oral therapy where metformin is not appropriate or not tolerated.

[MANAGING SULFONYLUREA-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA]
To manage sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia, infusion may be required for more than a day to prevent recurrence, especially with long-acting sulfonylureas. Forced alkaline diuresis may be used to enhance renal elimination if accumulation of chlorpropamide is suspected. The vasodilator diazoxide and the somatostatin analog octreotide have been used to inhibit insulin secretion in severe cases. 
----
[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SULFONYLUREAS]
Sulfonylureas can produce sensitivity reactions, usually transient cutaneous rashes, and rarely, erythema multiforme, fever, jaundice, acute porphyria, photosensitivity, and blood dyscrasias. Chlorpropamide, no longer commonly used, was known to cause facial flushing with alcohol and increased renal sensitivity to antidiuretic hormone, leading to water retention and hyponatremia. Glibenclamide is claimed to have a mild diuretic action.
----
[EFFECTIVENESS OF SULFONYLUREAS]
The efficacy of sulfonylureas depends on the stimulation of insulin secretion, but this rarely raises plasma insulin concentrations beyond the normal range. The suggestion that tolbutamide-induced hyperinsulinemia may have a detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system remains unsubstantiated. Sulfonylureas can be expected to reduce fasting plasma glucose by about 2-4 mmol/L, equating to a decrease in HbA1c of 1-2%.
----
[CONSIDERATIONS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY]
Further studies on the cardiovascular safety of sulfonylureas were prompted by the finding that two isoforms of the sulfonylurea receptor, SUR2A and SUR2B, are expressed in cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle. Sulfonylureas with a benzamido group (e.g., glibenclamide, glipizide, glimepiride) can interact with these receptors, but there is no clear evidence that therapeutic concentrations exert a significant effect. However, some authorities advocate minimizing the use of sulfonylureas in patients with overt coronary artery disease.
----
[PHARMACOKINETICS OF REPAGLINIDE]
Repaglinide is almost completely and rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations after about 1 hour, and is quickly metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. It produces a prompt insulin response when taken 15 minutes before a meal, lasting about 3 hours, coinciding with the duration of meal digestion. Nateglinide has a slightly faster onset and shorter duration of action. Repaglinide is mostly excreted in the bile.

----
[INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR PRANDIAL INSULIN RELEASERS]
Prandial insulin releasers, such as repaglinide, can be used as monotherapy in patients inadequately controlled by non-pharmacologic measures, particularly those with post-prandial glycemic excursions and near-normal fasting glycemia. They are also suitable for individuals with irregular lifestyles and unpredictable meals, as well as elderly patients with a lower risk of hypoglycemia. However, the need for multiple daily dosages may be a disincentive for some patients.

----
[MODE OF ACTION OF PRANDIAL INSULIN RELEASERS]
Prandial insulin releasers, such as repaglinide, bind to the benzamido site on the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 in the plasma membrane of the islet β-cells, causing closure of the K+ ATP channel and prompting insulin secretion. This action is similar to that of sulfonylureas, but with distinct binding affinities and durations of action, allowing for potential combination therapy with sulfonylureas to fit unusual meal patterns.

----
[ADMINISTRATION AND DOSING OF REPAGLINIDE]
Repaglinide is ideally taken 15-30 minutes before a meal, with a low initial dose (e.g., 0.5 mg) and gradual titration every 2 weeks up to a maximum of 4 mg before each main meal. The dose should be omitted if a meal is not consumed, and caution is advised when administering repaglinide to patients with moderate renal impairment.
----
[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF PRANDIAL INSULIN RELEASERS]
Hypoglycemic episodes are fewer and less severe with prandial insulin releasers than with sulfonylureas. Sensitivity reactions, usually transient, are uncommon. Prandial insulin releasers may cause a small increase in body weight when started as initial monotherapy, but body weight is little affected among patients switched from a sulfonylurea or when a prandial insulin releaser is combined with metformin.
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES]
Thiazolidinediones are potent agonists of PPAR-γ, which improves whole-body insulin sensitivity. The first thiazolidinedione to enter routine clinical use was troglitazone. Thiazolidinediones have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce hyperglycemia.
----
[PRANDIAL INSULIN RELEASERS AS MONOTHERAPY]
Nateglinide can be used as monotherapy, although it tends to be faster and shorter acting than repaglinide, and requires caution in patients with hepatic disease. In some countries, nateglinide is not licensed for use as monotherapy, only for combination therapy.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPY WITH PRANDIAL INSULIN RELEASERS]
If the desired glycemic target is not met with a prandial insulin releaser, consider early introduction of combination therapy with an agent to reduce insulin resistance. Prandial insulin releasers can also be useful add-ons to monotherapy with metformin or a thiazolidinedione.
----
[EFFICACY OF PRANDIAL INSULIN RELEASERS]
Repaglinide and nateglinide produce dose-dependent increases in insulin concentrations and reduce post-prandial hyperglycemia. Reductions in HbA1c are similar to or smaller than with sulfonylureas. As add-ons to metformin, they can reduce HbA1c by an additional 0.5-1.5% (6-17 mmol/mol).
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES INTRODUCTION]
Thiazolidinediones are a class of antidiabetic drugs that were introduced in the USA in 1997, with troglitazone being the first, but it was withdrawn in 2000 due to hepatotoxicity. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone were later introduced in the USA in 1999 and in Europe in 2000, and are available in fixed-dose combinations with metformin. These drugs have been found to be safe and effective in improving insulin sensitivity.

----
[MODE OF ACTION]
The antidiabetic efficacy of thiazolidinediones is primarily achieved through the stimulation of PPAR-γ, leading to increased insulin sensitivity. PPAR-γ is highly expressed in adipose tissue and, to a lesser extent, in muscle and liver, and its activation alters the transcriptional activity of various insulin-sensitive genes. This results in improved glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as reduced inflammation.

----
[GLUCOSE METABOLISM EFFECTS]
Thiazolidinediones promote the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes, which are sensitive to insulin and have increased uptake of fatty acids, leading to reduced circulating free fatty acids. This, in turn, facilitates glucose utilization and restricts fatty acid availability for hepatic gluconeogenesis, ultimately improving glucose metabolism. Additionally, thiazolidinediones increase glucose uptake into adipose tissue and skeletal muscle via increased availability of GLUT 4 glucose transporters.

----
[ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS]
Thiazolidinediones have anti-inflammatory effects, including reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and increased production of adiponectin, which enhances insulin action and has beneficial effects on vascular reactivity. These effects contribute to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.
----
[CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS]
The use of thiazolidinediones is contraindicated in patients with evidence of heart failure, and caution is advised in patients with pre-existing liver disease or those at higher risk of cardiac failure. Patients should be monitored for signs of cardiac failure and liver dysfunction, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels should be measured before starting therapy and periodically thereafter. Contraindications also include development of clinical hepatic dysfunction or elevated ALT levels > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

----
[USAGE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS]
Thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, can be used in the elderly and in patients with mild renal impairment, but with caution due to the potential for edema. They can also be considered for women with anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but should not be continued in pregnancy.

----
[EFFICACY AND DOSING]
Thiazolidinediones produce a slowly generated antihyperglycemic effect, which usually requires 2-3 months to reach maximum effect. The therapeutic response can vary considerably between individuals, and it is recommended to consider switching to another treatment if there is no clinically meaningful effect after 3 months. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have similar blood glucose-lowering effects, reducing HbA1c by around 0.5-1.5% (6-17 mmol/mol).

----
[MECHANISM OF ACTION]
Thiazolidinediones are antihyperglycemic agents that require the presence of sufficient insulin to generate their blood glucose-lowering effect. They can affect responsive genes in various tissues, leading to "pleiotropic effects." Plasma insulin concentrations are typically lowered by thiazolidinediones, and there is evidence that long-term viability of islet β-cells might be improved.

----
[PHARMACOKINETICS]
The absorption of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone is rapid and almost complete, with peak concentrations at 1-2 hours. Both drugs are metabolized extensively by the liver, with rosiglitazone having a plasma half-life of 100-160 hours and pioglitazone being metabolized to active metabolites that are eliminated in the bile. Rosiglitazone can interact with gemfibrozil, while pioglitazone does not appear to cause any clinically significant interactions.
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES EFFECTIVENESS]
Thiazolidinediones have a glucose-lowering effect that can last for more than 3 years, and their effectiveness may be better in patients with greater β-cell reserve and those who are overweight. They do not cause hypoglycemia as monotherapy and can reduce circulating non-esterified fatty acids. However, their effects on other components of the plasma lipid profile have been debated.
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES SIDE EFFECTS]
Thiazolidinediones can cause weight gain, typically 1-4 kg, which stabilizes over 6-12 months, and can alter the distribution of body fat. They can also increase the risk of bone fractures, particularly in postmenopausal women, and may have a slightly increased risk in men. Additionally, they can cause edema, reduced hemoglobin levels, and congestive heart disease.
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES BENEFITS]
Thiazolidinediones have been reported to exert beneficial effects on atherothrombotic risk markers, indices of vascular reactivity, and components of the metabolic syndrome. They can downregulate PAI-1 expression, decrease urinary albumin excretion, reduce cIMT and coronary restenosis, and reduce circulating markers of chronic low-grade inflammation.
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Thiazolidinediones may be contraindicated in patients with familial polyposis coli due to the theoretical risk of stimulating PPAR-γ in colonic cells, which may increase or decrease the risk of tumors. A check on bone density should be performed to exclude those at particular risk of bone fractures.
----
[GLIPTINS INTRODUCTION]
Gliptins are DPP-4 inhibitors that enhance incretin levels by preventing the rapid degradation of the incretin hormone, and they act as selective inhibitors of the enzyme DPP-4 to enhance endogenous incretin activity.
----
[PHARMACOKINETICS OF SITAGLIPTIN AND VILDAGLIPTIN]
Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are highly bioavailable, with approximately 87% and 85% bioavailability, respectively. They are rapidly absorbed, with a maximum concentration reached in 1-4 hours for sitagliptin and less than 2 hours for vildagliptin. Sitagliptin has a plasma half-life of 8-14 hours, while vildagliptin has a shorter half-life of 1.5-4.5 hours.
----
[INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR GLIPTINS]
Gliptins, such as sitagliptin and vildagliptin, can be used as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have responded inadequately to lifestyle measures. They are also used as add-on therapy in patients inadequately controlled by metformin or a thiazolidinedione. Gliptins are suitable for overweight and obese patients due to their lack of weight gain and low risk of hypoglycemia.
----
[MECHANISM OF ACTION OF DPP-4 INHIBITORS]
DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin and vildagliptin, work by inhibiting the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4, which breaks down incretin hormones. This leads to an increase in incretin levels, which enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion. The glucose-dependent mode of action reduces the risk of significant hypoglycemia.
----
[ADMINISTRATION AND DOSING OF SITAGLIPTIN AND VILDAGLIPTIN]
Sitagliptin is taken once daily, 100 mg in the morning, while vildagliptin is usually taken twice daily, 50 mg. The dosing schedule is designed to provide adequate inhibition of DPP-4 activity throughout the day, with sitagliptin providing near-complete inhibition for about 12 hours and vildagliptin providing almost complete inhibition for about 12 hours.
----
[GLIPTINS AND DPP-4 INHIBITORS]
Gliptins, also known as DPP-4 inhibitors, are a class of medications that enhance the effects of incretin hormones, such as GLP-1, to increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. They work by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, which normally breaks down these hormones. The main site of action is on the pancreas, and gliptins have been shown to have a neutral effect on weight and gastric emptying. 
----
[GLIPTIN AGENTS AND DOSING]
Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are two examples of gliptin agents, with dosages of 100 mg/day and 2 x 50 mg/day, respectively. The duration of action for these agents is 12-24 hours, and they are primarily eliminated through the urine. Sitagliptin requires dose adjustment in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency, while vildagliptin is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.
----
[CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS]
Gliptins are not recommended in patients with certain conditions, such as severe renal impairment or hepatic impairment. Liver function should be monitored before and during treatment, and gliptin therapy should be stopped in pregnancy. Additionally, gliptins should be used cautiously in patients with heart disease, and no significant drug interactions have been noted.
----
[EFFECTIVENESS OF GLIPTINS]
Sitagliptin has been shown to reduce HbA1c levels by approximately 0.7-0.8% (8-9 mmol/mol) after 24-52 weeks of treatment, with greater reductions seen in individuals with high baseline HbA1c levels. Fasting plasma glucose concentrations and post-prandial glucose levels have also been reduced with sitagliptin treatment.
----
[DPP-4 INHIBITORS]
DPP-4 inhibitors, also known as gliptins, have the potential to influence various physiological processes, including the hunger-satiety system, gastrointestinal motility, growth, vascular reactivity, and immune mechanisms. However, neither CD26 knockout mice nor DPP-4-specific inhibitors have shown significant untoward immune-related effects. It is still advisable to check for any evidence of skin lesions, as inhibition of related enzymes has produced adverse effects in some species.

----
[ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS]
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, miglitol, and voglibose, can retard the final steps of carbohydrate digestion, delaying the absorption of sugars and reducing post-prandial hyperglycemia in diabetes. These agents can lower blood glucose levels by about 3 mmol/L after meals. They have been introduced as oral antidiabetic agents to manage diabetes.

----
[SITAGLIPTIN THERAPY]
Sitagliptin therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing HbA1c levels without causing a significant increase in hypoglycemia. When combined with metformin, sitagliptin was associated with fewer hypoglycemic episodes than a combination of glipizide and metformin. Additionally, sitagliptin did not increase body weight compared to placebo in clinical trials.

----
[VILDAGLIPTIN THERAPY]
Vildagliptin has shown similar efficacy and tolerability to sitagliptin in clinical trials, with a single daily dose of 50-100 mg/day. Vildagliptin has been used as monotherapy or add-on to metformin or a thiazolidinedione, with no effect on hypoglycemia or body weight. However, slightly greater reductions in HbA1c were observed, mostly associated with higher average baseline HbA1c levels.

----
[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF GLIPTINS]
Clinical experience with gliptins has not identified any serious adverse effects. Measures of tolerability and adverse events have been generally similar to placebo or comparator in clinical trials. However, some increases in liver enzymes were observed with a 100 mg dose of vildagliptin, and nominal increases in reported signs or symptoms of abdominal discomfort were noted.
----
[INTRODUCTION TO ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS]
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors can be used as monotherapy or add-on therapy to target post-prandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. They are most effective for patients with slightly raised fasting glycemia and can also be used to extend the post-prandial period and reduce interprandial glycemic troughs or hypoglycemia. These inhibitors can also prevent the progression of impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes. 
----
[INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are indicated for patients with type 2 diabetes who consume complex digestible carbohydrates. However, they are contraindicated for patients with a history of chronic intestinal disease. High dosages of acarbose can increase liver enzyme concentrations, and it is recommended to measure transaminase concentrations periodically in patients receiving maximum dosages. 
----
[MODE OF ACTION]
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors competitively inhibit the activity of alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of enterocytes, delaying the completion of carbohydrate digestion and deferring glucose absorption. Different alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have different affinities for various alpha-glucosidase enzymes, resulting in slightly different activity profiles. 
----
[PHARMACOKINETICS AND ADMINISTRATION]
Acarbose is degraded by amylases in the small intestine and should be taken with meals, starting with a low dose and slowly uptitrated over several weeks. Monitoring of post-prandial glycemia is often helpful, and hypoglycemia is unlikely when used as monotherapy. However, gastrointestinal symptoms are common, limiting initial tolerability and dose titration. 
----
[EFFICACY AND SAFETY]
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors can effectively reduce post-prandial glucose excursions in patients who consume meals containing complex carbohydrates. They have a good safety record, but their application has been limited by gastrointestinal side effects.
----
[ORAL ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS FOR WEIGHT LOSS]
Oral antidiabetic agents, such as the intestinal lipase inhibitor orlistat, can aid in weight loss and improve dietary compliance in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Orlistat can reduce dietary fat absorption by up to 30% and lead to additional reductions in HbA1c of 0.28-1.1%. The satiety-inducing serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor sibutramine can also enable greater reductions in body weight and HbA1c.
----
[FIXED-DOSE COMBINATIONS OF ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
Fixed-dose combinations of two or more oral antidiabetic agents with different mechanisms of action are becoming increasingly common in the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. These combinations can offer convenience, reduce pill burden, and increase patient adherence, while also providing similar efficacy to separate tablets. Current fixed-dose combinations include metformin combined with a sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, gliptin, or meglitinide.
----
[EFFECTIVENESS OF ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS]
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors can reduce peak post-prandial glucose concentrations by 1-4 mmol/L and decrease HbA1c by 0.5-1.0% when used as monotherapy. These agents offer several useful features, including no weight gain or frank hypoglycemia, and may reduce interprandial episodes of hypoglycemia. When combined with other antidiabetic agents, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors can reduce post-prandial hyperinsulinemia and lower plasma triglyceride concentrations.
----
[CONTRAINDICATIONS AND SIDE EFFECTS OF ANTIOBESITY THERAPIES]
Antiobesity therapies, such as orlistat, carry their own contraindications, cautions, and side effects, and may interfere with the absorption and activity of some oral antidiabetic agents, particularly alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. It is essential to consider these potential interactions when using antiobesity therapies in combination with antidiabetic agents.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Early, effective, and sustained glycemic control is essential to minimize vulnerability to vascular complications later in life. Monitoring and therapeutic adjustments for efficacy, safety, and avoidance of hypoglycemia require constant vigilance. Addressing cardiovascular risk and co-morbid conditions is also crucial in diabetes management.
----
[ALGORITHM FOR TREATING HYPERGLYCEMIA IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
A stepped approach is typically used to treat hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, starting with lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise, followed by the addition of pharmacologic therapy if necessary. The treatment plan should be individualized to suit the patient's circumstances, and the value of lifestyle intervention should not be underestimated. A range of oral agents is available, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones.
----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Treatment options for type 2 diabetes include oral agents such as metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and gliptins, as well as injected incretin analogs. Insulin should be considered when other therapies do not provide adequate glycemic control or are unsuitable. Combination therapy with two or more different classes of agents may also be used to achieve glycemic control.
----
[ROLE OF LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION]
Lifestyle intervention, including diet, exercise, and weight control, is an essential component of diabetes management and should be used as initial and ongoing therapy in conjunction with pharmacologic agents. The importance of lifestyle intervention should not be underestimated, and it should be individualized to suit the patient's circumstances.
----
[INTRODUCTION TO METFORMIN]
Metformin is a widely used oral antidiabetic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been shown to have beneficial effects on micro and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes. Metformin's mechanism of action involves the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolism.

----
[METFORMIN'S EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE PRODUCTION]
Metformin has been found to suppress hepatic glucose production and stimulate glucose uptake in type 2 diabetes. This is achieved through its effects on the liver, where it decreases glucose production, and on the muscles, where it increases glucose uptake. This leads to improved glycemic control and reduced risk of complications.

----
[COMBINATION THERAPY WITH METFORMIN]
Combination therapy with metformin and other antidiabetic agents, such as sulphonylureas, has been shown to be effective in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the combination of metformin and sulphonylureas may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the choice of combination therapy.

----
[METFORMIN'S ROLE IN PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS]
The UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group found that intensive blood-glucose control with metformin reduced the risk of complications in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin has also been shown to have beneficial effects on haemostasis and vascular function, which may contribute to its ability to prevent complications.

----
[GENETIC STUDIES ON TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Genome-wide association studies have identified novel risk loci for type 2 diabetes, which may help to identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease. Understanding the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes may also lead to the development of new treatments and therapies.
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES IN DIABETES TREATMENT]
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity. They work by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), which helps regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. Examples of TZDs include rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which have been shown to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[METFORMIN AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Metformin is a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes by reducing insulin resistance and improving glycemic control. It can be used in combination with other medications, such as TZDs, to enhance its effects. Metformin has been shown to be effective in preserving pancreatic beta-cell function and preventing type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals.

----
[CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF DIABETES MEDICATIONS]
Certain diabetes medications, such as TZDs, have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure and myocardial infarction. However, other studies have shown that these medications can also have beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes, such as reducing the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. The American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association have issued consensus statements on the use of TZDs in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

----
[COMPARISON OF DIABETES MEDICATIONS]
Different diabetes medications have varying effects on glycemic control, lipid profiles, and body weight. For example, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone have been compared in terms of their effects on lipid and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Additionally, metformin has been shown to have a favorable effect on body weight compared to other diabetes medications.

----
[NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN DIABETES TREATMENT]
New medications and treatment strategies are being developed to improve the management of type 2 diabetes. These include the use of TZDs and other medications to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and improve glycemic control. Additionally, lifestyle interventions and pharmacological treatments can be used to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals.
----
[ORAL ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
Oral antidiabetic agents, such as sitagliptin and vildagliptin, are used to treat type 2 diabetes. These agents, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, have been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control. Sitagliptin, for example, has been compared to the sulfonylurea glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin alone.

----
[ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS]
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, are another class of oral antidiabetic agents used to treat type 2 diabetes. These inhibitors have been shown to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Acarbose has been studied in several trials, including the STOP-NIDDM trial, which demonstrated its effectiveness in preventing diabetes mellitus.

----
[INCRETIN THERAPY]
Incretin therapy, which includes DPP-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes. Incretin therapy works by enhancing the body's own incretin effect, which helps to regulate blood glucose levels. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of incretin therapy in improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

----
[DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-4 INHIBITORS]
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, such as sitagliptin and vildagliptin, are a class of oral antidiabetic agents that work by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4. This inhibition increases the levels of incretin hormones, such as GLP-1, which helps to regulate blood glucose levels. DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control and are generally well-tolerated.
----
[INCRETIN HORMONES]
Incretins are gut hormones that enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and play a crucial role in regulating post-prandial glucose levels. The major incretin hormones are glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). These hormones have a significant impact on glucose control and are being targeted by new therapies. 
----
[GLP-1 PHYSIOLOGIC ACTIONS]
The physiologic actions of GLP-1 include potentiation of meal-induced insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, delay in gastric emptying, and suppression of food intake and appetite. GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as exenatide and liraglutide, have been shown to improve glycemic control and promote mild weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
----
[AMYLIN PHYSIOLOGIC ACTIONS]
Amylin is a naturally occurring peptide that is co-secreted with insulin from the β-cells of the pancreatic islets. The physiologic actions of amylin include delayed gastric emptying, suppression of post-prandial glucagon secretion, and increased satiety. Pramlintide, a synthetic amylin mimetic, has been approved for use in insulin-treated subjects with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 
----
[NON-INSULIN PARENTERAL THERAPIES]
Non-insulin parenteral therapies include activators of the GLP-1 receptor, also called "incretin mimetics," as well as amylin mimetics. These therapies have been shown to improve glycemic control and promote weight loss, with common adverse events including nausea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia. GLP-1 receptor agonists, in particular, have been found to have cardiovascular benefits, including protection of the ischemic heart and improved left ventricular ejection fraction. 
----
[INCRETIN EFFECT]
The "incretin effect" refers to the amplification of insulin secretion elicited by hormones secreted from the gastrointestinal tract. This effect is quantified by comparing insulin responses to oral and intravenous glucose administration, and is thought to play a particularly important role in the regulation of post-prandial glucose levels. In healthy subjects, the oral administration of glucose causes a two- to threefold larger insulin response than the intravenous route, due to the actions of the incretin hormones.
----
[GLP-1 MECHANISMS]
GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through mechanisms that are not fully understood, but it is known to potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The insulinotropic activity of GLP-1 is exerted via interaction with the GLP-1 receptor on the cell membrane of β-cells, leading to the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and a subsequent increase in insulin secretion. This effect is strictly glucose-dependent, meaning that GLP-1 only stimulates insulin secretion in the presence of high glucose levels.

----
[INCRETIN EFFECT IN T2DM]
The incretin effect, which is the increase in insulin secretion in response to oral glucose compared to intravenous glucose, is severely reduced in T2DM. However, research suggests that intensified treatment resulting in near-normal glucose levels may lead to a partial restoration of incretin action of GLP-1 and GIP. Additionally, induction of insulin resistance in healthy subjects is associated with a loss of the incretin effect.

----
[GLP-1 THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS]
GLP-1 has several therapeutic effects that make it a potential treatment for diabetes, including enhancing insulin secretion, promoting β-cell proliferation, and increasing insulin sensitivity. GLP-1 also has trophic effects on β-cells, stimulating their growth and survival, and upregulating genes involved in insulin secretion. These effects make GLP-1 a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of T2DM.

----
[CLINICAL IMPORTANCE OF GLP-1]
The clinical importance of GLP-1 lies in its potential to enhance insulin secretion and improve glucose control in patients with T2DM. However, the use of GLP-1 agonists in combination with sulfonylurea drugs may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, as sulfonylureas can uncouple the glucose dependency of GLP-1. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits of GLP-1 therapy in clinical practice.
----
[GLP-1 EFFECTS ON GLUCAGON SECRETION]
GLP-1 strongly inhibits glucagon secretion, which is important in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who often experience fasting hyperglucagonemia. This effect may be as important as the insulinotropic effects of GLP-1. The mechanism of GLP-1's inhibition of glucagon secretion is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve paracrine inhibition of α-cells by somatostatin-producing D-cells in the islets.
----
[GLP-1 EFFECTS ON GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT]
GLP-1 inhibits gastrointestinal secretion and motility, including gastric emptying, which can help reduce post-prandial glucose excursions. This effect may be beneficial in reducing the number of episodes with high post-prandial glucose levels. However, there has been concern that this effect could be problematic in patients with gastroparesis, although no cases have been reported.
----
[GLP-1 EFFECTS ON APPETITE AND FOOD INTAKE]
GLP-1 inhibits appetite and food intake in both normal subjects and obese subjects with T2DM, leading to sustained or progressive weight loss over several years. GLP-1 is thought to be one of the gastrointestinal hormones that normally regulate food intake.
----
[GLP-1 CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS]
GLP-1 receptors are present in the heart, and recent studies have indicated a physiologic function for these receptors. GLP-1 may also have trophic effects on β-cells, enhancing their differentiation and inhibiting apoptosis, which could be useful in conditions with increased β-cell apoptosis.
----
[GLP-1 MECHANISM OF ACTION]
GLP-1 is extensively degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and its actions on β-cells may be exerted indirectly via activation of long vagovagal reflexes. The GLP-1 receptor is expressed in cell bodies in the nodose ganglion, and blockade of the autonomic ganglia has been shown to block the effects of GLP-1 on insulin secretion.
----
[GLP-1 EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE]
Chronic administration of GLP-1 agonists is associated with small but significant decreases in blood pressure, which may be due to the vasodilatory actions of GLP-1. This effect has been observed in various animal experimental models. GLP-1 has been shown to have a positive impact on blood pressure, making it a potential therapeutic agent for cardiovascular diseases. 
----
[NEUROTROPIC EFFECTS OF GLP-1]
GLP-1 has been found to have neurotropic effects, including improved learning in rats and neuroprotective effects. It has also been proposed as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. GLP-1 has been shown to modify the processing of amyloid precursor protein and protect against oxidative injury.
----
[ACTIONS OF GLP-1 IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
GLP-1 has been shown to have preserved insulinotropic actions in patients with type 2 diabetes. Intravenous infusion of GLP-1 has been demonstrated to completely normalize plasma glucose in patients with long-standing severe disease. However, the effect of subcutaneous injections of GLP-1 is short-lasting due to its rapid metabolism in the body.
----
[GLP-1 METABOLISM AND DEGRADATION]
GLP-1 has a short half-life of 1-2 minutes and is rapidly metabolized by the enzyme DPP-4, which renders it inactive with respect to insulin secretion. The metabolic instability of GLP-1 makes it challenging to use as a therapeutic agent, but its metabolite GLP-1 9-36 amide may still have cardiovascular effects.
----
[GLP-1 CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS]
GLP-1 has been shown to have protective effects on the heart, including increasing left ventricular pressure and coronary blood flow, and protecting the ischemic and reperfused myocardium. These effects may be mediated by a different receptor than the classic GLP-1 receptor and may have important clinical implications for patients with cardiovascular disease.
----
[EXENATIDE CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Exenatide is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure, defined as a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/minute, due to its elimination by glomerular filtration. This is important to consider when prescribing exenatide to patients with kidney disease. Exenatide's pharmacokinetics and potential side effects should be carefully evaluated in patients with impaired kidney function.

----
[EXENATIDE ADMINISTRATION AND EFFECTS]
Exenatide is administered twice daily, within 60 minutes of morning and evening meals, and lowers glucose levels for 5-7 hours. It primarily affects post-prandial glycemic excursion, with modest effects on lunch hyperglycemia and fasting blood glucose. The main side effect of exenatide is nausea, which is dose-dependent but may show some tachyphylaxis. 

----
[EXENATIDE MECHANISM OF ACTION]
Exenatide improves glucose metabolism through several mechanisms, including increased insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and delayed gastric emptying. These actions are similar to those of GLP-1, but exenatide has significantly greater glucoregulatory potency. Understanding the mechanism of action of exenatide is essential for optimizing its use in diabetes management.

----
[EXENATIDE CLINICAL EFFICACY]
Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of exenatide in improving glycemic control, with placebo-corrected reductions in HbA1c of 0.9-1.0% (10-11 mmol/mol) and weight loss of 1.6-2.6 kg after 30 weeks. Exenatide has also been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors, including increases in HDL cholesterol and decreases in triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure. These benefits make exenatide a valuable treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[EXENATIDE COMPARISON TO OTHER TREATMENTS]
Exenatide has been compared to other treatments, including insulin glargine and biphasic insulin, in clinical trials. These studies have shown that exenatide is effective in reducing HbA1c and body weight, with a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to insulin therapy. The results of these studies can inform treatment decisions and help healthcare providers choose the best option for their patients.
----
[LIRAGLUTIDE OVERVIEW]
Liraglutide is a once-daily human GLP-1 analog with a half-life of about 13 hours following subcutaneous injection. It is relatively stable towards DPP-4 degradation and forms heptameric aggregates, which contributes to its stability. Liraglutide is based on the structure of native GLP-1 with an amino acid substitution and attachment of a C16 acyl chain.

----
[LIRAGLUTIDE CLINICAL STUDIES]
In clinical studies, liraglutide has been shown to reduce HbA1c levels more than glimepiride and rosiglitazone. The LEAD development program demonstrated that liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.84% and 1.14%, respectively, over 52 weeks. Liraglutide also resulted in weight loss, with a weight difference of 3.2-3.6 kg compared to glimepiride.

----
[LIRAGLUTIDE DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION]
The initial dose of liraglutide was escalated weekly in a stepwise fashion from 0.6 mg/day to 1.2 mg/day, and in some patients to 1.8 mg/day. Steady-state concentrations are obtained after 3-4 days of treatment. Liraglutide can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic medications, such as metformin.

----
[LIRAGLUTIDE SIDE EFFECTS AND SAFETY]
Common side effects of liraglutide include nausea, which occurred in 29% of participants in clinical trials. The rates of minor hypoglycemic episodes were significantly lower for liraglutide compared to glimepiride. Liraglutide has also been associated with weight loss and improvements in blood pressure.

----
[COMPARISON WITH OTHER TREATMENTS]
Liraglutide has been compared to other treatments, including exenatide and insulin, in clinical trials. Exenatide has been shown to have similar efficacy to liraglutide in reducing HbA1c levels, but with a greater proportion of patients reaching HbA1c < 7.0%. Exenatide has also been associated with weight loss and improvements in blood pressure.
----
[LIRAGLUTIDE TREATMENT EFFECTS]
Liraglutide treatment has been associated with a reduction in HbA1c levels, with a further 0.3% reduction observed after switching from exenatide.

[COMPARISON OF GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS AND DPP-4 INHIBITORS]
GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors differ in route of administration and may have differing side effect and tolerability profiles. Head-to-head studies have compared liraglutide with other treatments, including glimepiride, insulin glargine, and exenatide, with liraglutide showing improved reductions in HbA1c and weight loss in some studies.
----
[GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS]
GLP-1 receptor agonists are a class of medications that are attractive for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their glucose-dependent effects on insulin and glucagon secretion, which reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. These medications also induce weight loss, which is beneficial for many people with T2DM who are obese. Examples of GLP-1 receptor agonists include taspoglutide, lixisenatide, and exenatide once weekly.
----
[GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONIST EFFICACY]
Studies have shown that GLP-1 receptor agonists can reduce HbA1c levels and body weight in people with T2DM. For example, taspoglutide reduced HbA1c by 1.4-1.5% and body weight by 2.1-2.8 kg after 8 weeks of treatment. Lixisenatide and exenatide once weekly have also demonstrated efficacy in reducing HbA1c and body weight in clinical trials.
----
[GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONIST SAFETY AND FUTURE STUDIES]

[FUTURE GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS]
Several new GLP-1 receptor agonists are in development, including exenatide once weekly, which has shown efficacy in reducing HbA1c and body weight in clinical trials. Other GLP-1 receptor agonists in development include orally administered and intranasal formulations, which may offer greater convenience and flexibility for people with T2DM.
----
[AMYLIN EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Amylin has been shown to affect glucose metabolism in various studies, particularly in rodents, where it leads to insulin resistance, inhibits glycogen synthase activity, and enhances glycogen breakdown and lactate release. Additionally, amylin inhibits glucagon secretion in a dose-dependent manner and delays gastric emptying. These effects are more potent than those of other gastrointestinal hormones. 
----
[AMYLIN EFFECTS IN HUMAN STUDIES]
In human studies, the administration of native amylin has not demonstrated a significant impact on glucose uptake, even at high pharmacologic doses. However, the amylin analog pramlintide has shown promising results in improving glucose control, with a decrease in HbA1c of 0.4-0.6% compared to placebo over a period of 6-12 months.
----
[PRAMLINTIDE TREATMENT EFFECTS]
Pramlintide, an amylin analog, has been approved by the FDA for use in insulin-treated subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Treatment with pramlintide has resulted in a significant decrease in HbA1c and a small but clinically significant weight loss. The main side effects of pramlintide are nausea and hypoglycemia, which can be reduced with titration and adjustment of insulin dose.
----
[AMYLIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION]
Amylin, also known as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), is a 37 amino acid peptide that belongs to the family of peptides related to calcitonin and adrenomedullin. It is co-localized with insulin in secretory granules and is processed by the same enzyme before being released from the pancreas. Amylin has approximately 50% sequence identity to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).
----
[PRAMLINTIDE OVERVIEW]
Pramlintide is a non-insulin parenteral therapy approved by the FDA in 2005 for use in insulin-treated patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. It is administered subcutaneously and has a plasma half-life of approximately 48 minutes. Pramlintide is primarily eliminated by the kidneys and is often dosed at 60-90 μg three to four times per day prior to meals for patients with Type 1 diabetes, and at higher doses twice per day for patients with Type 2 diabetes.
----
[PRAMLINTIDE MECHANISM OF ACTION]
Pramlintide works by suppressing glucagon secretion, which leads to a decrease in endogenous glucose production. This results in a reduction in post-prandial glucose levels, with an estimated 25% reduction in plasma glucose. Pramlintide also slows gastric emptying, which contributes to its glucose-lowering effect.
----
[PRAMLINTIDE DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION]
Pramlintide dosing should be titrated to optimize efficacy and minimize nausea, a common side effect. Normal dosing for patients with Type 1 diabetes is 60-90 μg three to four times per day prior to meals, while patients with Type 2 diabetes may require higher doses administered twice per day. The peptide is administered subcutaneously into the abdominal area or the thigh.
----
[AMYLIN AND INSULIN SECRETION]
Amylin secretion is impaired in patients with Type 2 diabetes and absent in patients with Type 1 diabetes, similar to insulin secretion. Plasma amylin concentrations are lower in patients with diabetes compared to healthy subjects, and amylin secretion is impaired in response to meal ingestion.
----
[INCRETIN EFFECT IN DIABETES]
The incretin effect plays a significant role in type 2 diabetes mellitus, with reduced incretin effect observed in type 2 diabetic patients and obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) are insulinotropic at basal and postprandial glucose levels, contributing to the incretin effect of a meal in healthy subjects. However, the incretin effect is impaired in type 2 diabetes, which may contribute to the development of the disease.

----
[INCRETIN HORMONES AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM]
Incretin hormones, such as GLP-1 and GIP, have additive insulinotropic effects and contribute to improved glucose metabolism. The incretin system, including GLP-1 and GIP, plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism, and its impairment may lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Understanding the incretin system and its role in glucose metabolism can provide insights into the development of new treatments for type 2 diabetes.

----
[PRAMLINTIDE AND GLUCOSE CONTROL]
Pramlintide, a selective DPP-4 inhibitor, has been shown to increase active GLP-1 concentrations and improve glucose control in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Long-term studies have demonstrated that pramlintide can lead to a decrease in HbA1c of 0.4-0.6% (4-7 mmol/mol) compared with placebo, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent for improving glucose control in diabetic patients.

----
[TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS]
The understanding of the incretin effect and the role of incretin hormones in glucose metabolism has implications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Therapies that target the incretin system, such as DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, may provide new treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes, offering improved glucose control and potentially reducing the risk of complications associated with the disease.
----
[GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1 FUNCTION]
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) promotes DNA synthesis, activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and increases transcription factor pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (PDX-1) DNA binding activity in beta cells. GLP-1 receptor agonists are growth and differentiation factors for pancreatic islet beta cells, stimulating both beta-cell replication and neogenesis. This results in increased beta-cell mass and improved glucose tolerance in diabetic rats. GLP-1 also inhibits cell apoptosis and improves glucose responsiveness of freshly isolated human islets.

----
[GLP-1 THERAPEUTIC ACTIONS]
GLP-1 mediates the therapeutic actions of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, which increase portal concentrations of active GLP-1. The DPP-IV inhibitor vildagliptin increases portal concentrations of active GLP-1 to a greater extent than peripheral concentrations. GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as exendin-4, stimulate expression of homeodomain protein IDX-1 and increase islet size in mouse pancreas.

----
[GLP-1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
In type 2 diabetic patients, the secretion of GLP-1 is impaired, contributing to postprandial hyperglycemia. The lack of suppression of glucagon also contributes to postprandial hyperglycemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Determinants of the impaired secretion of GLP-1 in type 2 diabetic patients include neuronal mechanisms and receptor gene expression.

----
[GLP-1 PHYSIOLOGY]
GLP-1 is transformed to GLP-1-(9-36)amide by dipeptidyl peptidase IV in the capillaries supplying the L cells of the porcine intestine. Portal GLP-1 administration in rats augments the insulin response to glucose via neuronal mechanisms. The biology of incretin hormones, including GLP-1, plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.
----
[GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1 EFFECTS]

----
[AMYLIN THERAPY EFFECTIVENESS]
Studies have found that pramlintide can be an effective adjunctive treatment for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, improving glycemic control and promoting weight loss. However, other studies have found that very high concentrations of islet amyloid polypeptide are necessary to alter the insulin response to intravenous glucose in humans, and that amylin may not have an acute effect on insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp in humans.
----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is expected to increase from 285 million people in 2009 to 435 million by 2030. In the USA, nearly 24 million people have diabetes, mostly T2DM, and at least 57 million people have pre-diabetes. The increasing prevalence of diabetes is related to environmental and genetic factors, which influence insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion capacity.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
Relative insulin deficiency is the defining metabolic difference between obesity and the development of hyperglycemia with progression to T2DM. An inexorable progression of diabetes appears related to worsening insulin deficiency, and most people have gradually increasing needs for additional therapy. Combinations of therapy, such as adopting a therapeutic lifestyle change, as well as oral and injectable medicines, are required to keep glycemia under control.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS]
Several approaches to the best management of T2DM have been proposed, all of which begin with therapeutic lifestyle change and focus primarily on controlling hyperglycemia. Consensus statements from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend evidence-directed therapy to normalize hyperglycemia and minimize cardiometabolic risk. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that new medicines for glycemic control in diabetes be evaluated for their effects on cardiovascular disease.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Clinical trials continue to show that glycemic control is critical to reduce microvascular complications and, in the long term, cardiovascular events. However, poor glycemic control, hypoglycemia, and obesity remain stubborn barriers for clinicians. The failure to advance therapy at an early sign of therapeutic failure, particularly a reluctance to advance to insulin, underlies the less than optimum control for many patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES TREATMENT ALGORITHM]
The current consensus algorithm for diabetes treatment starts with metformin and moves to the addition of sulfonylurea or insulin if metformin treatment fails. Newer classes of drugs, such as incretin mimetics and pioglitazone, are recommended later due to limited data on their superiority and potential side effects. The treatment pathway must be individualized based on patient needs and clinical experience.

----
[GOALS OF TREATMENT]
The goals of treatment for patients with diabetes have changed significantly over the past two decades, with a focus on glycemic control to prevent microvascular complications. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends an HbA1c goal of <7% (<53 mmol/mol), with individualization recommended for properly selected patients. More rigorous normalization of glycemia to 6% (42 mmol/mol) HbA1c can be recommended if achievable without hypoglycemia problems.

----
[TIER 1 TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Tier 1 treatment options include well-validated core therapies such as lifestyle changes, metformin, basal insulin, sulfonylureas, and pioglitazone. These therapies have a strong evidence base and are recommended as first-line treatments for diabetes. The choice of therapy depends on individual patient needs and clinical experience.

----
[TIER 2 TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Tier 2 treatment options include less well-validated therapies such as GLP-1 agonists, thiazolidinediones, and DPP-4 inhibitors. These therapies have less follow-up and validation in clinical trials, but may be appropriate choices for selected patients. The choice of therapy depends on individual patient needs and clinical experience.

----
[RECOMMENDED HBA1C GOALS]
The ADA recommends an HbA1c goal of <7% (<53 mmol/mol), while the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) suggest a goal of ≤6.5% (48 mmol/mol). Individualization of treatment goals is recommended based on patient needs and clinical experience.
----
[DIABETES EDUCATION AND LIFESTYLE CHANGE]
The role of the physician is critical in emphasizing the importance of lifestyle change to the patient, initiating a process of working on lifestyle change, and reinforcing education to achieve incremental obtainable objectives. Motivational interviewing and assessment of readiness to change are important aspects of evaluation. A useful acronym to help patients make lifestyle change is FIRM, which stands for negotiating Few changes, Individualized changes, Realistic changes, and Measureable changes. This approach helps patients set moderate, achievable goals within a specific timeframe.

----
[OBESITY TREATMENT FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Therapy for obesity is a useful treatment for Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) as it helps gain control of glycemia and favorably influences multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Successful weight loss of 10% or less has been shown to improve glycemic control, lipids, hypertension, and other cardiac risk factors. Pharmacotherapy for obesity, such as orlistat, can be considered as part of a treatment plan for T2DM.

----
[ORLISTAT FOR OBESITY MANAGEMENT]
Orlistat is currently approved for use in the management of obesity and functions as a gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor. When given at a dosage of 120 mg three times daily with meals, approximately 20-30% of ingested fat is passed into the feces. However, this can result in gastrointestinal side effects such as anal leakage of oil and post-prandial diarrhea, which can be managed with dietary counseling or adjusted dosing.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Recent analysis of the ACCORD trial cautions against attempting to normalize glycemia in patients with characteristics such as older age and existing cardiovascular disease, as this may increase the risk of fatal cardiovascular events. The goal of glycemic control should be individualized based on co-morbidities and vulnerability to hypoglycemia, among other criteria.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR DIABETES]
Combination therapies for diabetes, including medications and surgical options, are increasingly being utilized to manage the condition. Bariatric surgery, for example, has been shown to have favorable effects on type 2 diabetes management, with many patients experiencing long-standing remissions. The physiology behind these benefits is not yet fully understood, but paradigms for identifying suitable patients are evolving. Typically, patients who undergo bariatric surgery are able to stop insulin therapy unless they have a long history of diabetes.

----
[PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Therapies for type 2 diabetes can be divided into drugs that facilitate the supply of endogenous insulin and those that enhance insulin actions. Successful treatment of type 2 diabetes often combines lifestyle modification with pharmacologic therapy, and the choice of therapy depends on the dual aspects of the condition: insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. The UKPDS study found that insulin secretory loss starts on average 10 years before the formal diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, followed by insulin deficiency on average 10-12 years after diagnosis.

----
[BARITRIC SURGERY AND INSULIN REQUIREMENTS]
Bariatric surgery can significantly reduce insulin requirements in patients with type 2 diabetes. During the hypocaloric diet preparation for surgery, patients often experience decreases in insulin needs, and after surgery, most patients are able to stop insulin therapy unless they have a long history of diabetes. In some cases, such as after Roux-en-Y procedures, insulin requirements can decrease rapidly within days to weeks, and decreasing insulin dosage by half or more may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia.

----
[ORLISTAT AND DIABETES PREVENTION]
Orlistat, a medication used for weight loss, has been studied for its potential to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes. The XENDOS trial found that orlistat reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 37% in obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Additionally, orlistat has been shown to have favorable lipid effects, making it a potential adjunct therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPY FOR DIABETES]
Combining treatments with complementary actions can be a logical approach to managing diabetes, offering several distinct advantages, including superior efficacy. Combination therapy has been shown to be more effective than switching from one medication to another, with studies demonstrating improved glycemic control when using multiple agents with different mechanisms. This approach can also help balance the treatment of preprandial and postprandial hyperglycemia.

----
[ADVANTAGES OF COMBINATION THERAPY]
The advantages of combination therapy include improved efficacy, tolerability, and convenience. Most side effects of glycemic medications are dose-related, and combination therapy can help minimize these effects by using lower doses of individual agents. Additionally, combination therapy can provide a more flexible approach to managing diabetes, allowing for the use of different agents to target specific aspects of the disease.

----
[INITIAL THERAPY CHOICE FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The choice of initial therapy for type 2 diabetes is important, as it can impact the long-term success of treatment. While no therapy has been proven to alter the natural history of progressive β-cell decline, some agents have been shown to be more effective than others in the early stages of treatment. For example, the ADOPT trial found that rosiglitazone was associated with longer monotherapy success compared to metformin or glyburide.

----
[RATIONALE FOR COMBINATION THERAPY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The rationale for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes is based on the presence of multiple physiologic defects, including insulin resistance and progressive insulin secretory failure. Combination therapy can help address these defects by using agents with different mechanisms of action, such as insulin secretagogues and metformin. This approach can provide more comprehensive management of the disease and improve glycemic control.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR DIABETES]
Combination therapies for diabetes can be attractive for patients who need to take multiple medications for glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid abnormalities, and other problems. This approach can simplify treatment regimens and improve patient adherence. Combination pills, such as metformin-secretagogue or metformin-thiazolidinedione, have been introduced to enhance convenience. These combination therapies can minimize side effects while achieving equal or better glycemic control.
----
[SECRETAGOGUES IN DIABETES TREATMENT]
Secretagogues, whether rapid or longer-acting, work well with metformin and thiazolidinediones, and their use with basal insulin therapy is evidence-based. However, their use with two or more mealtime insulin doses is considered superfluous and may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Secretagogues work by binding to sulfonylurea receptors, which stimulates insulin release.
----
[INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
The use of secretagogues, particularly glyburide, should be avoided in patients with active ischemic heart disease due to the potential increased risk of mortality. This is based on the findings of the DIGAMI-1 study, which showed that insulin treatment reduced mortality from acute myocardial infarction in diabetes mellitus.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPY EFFICACY AND SAFETY]
The efficacy of oral agents in glucose lowering is often not linear with increasing dose, and dose escalation may increase undesirable side effects while gaining little in efficacy. Using lower doses of two complementary medications can minimize side effects while achieving equal or better glycemic control. Combination pills, such as metformin-secretagogue or metformin-thiazolidinedione, can provide a convenient and effective treatment option.
----
[NEWER COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR DIABETES]
Newer agents, such as sitagliptin, have been approved for use in combination with metformin and are available as combination pills. The trend towards using combination pills is likely to increase in the future, offering patients and practitioners a convenient and effective treatment option with dual actions.
----
[INITIATION OF TZD THERAPY]
Liver function tests are recommended to be performed prior to initiation of thiazolidinedione (TZD) therapy and periodically thereafter. Recent reports suggest that TZD therapy may improve elevated transaminase values and liver histology in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone effectively lower HbA1c levels. 
----
[EFFICACY OF TZD THERAPY]
Glycemic control is improved on average more with TZDs than with nateglinide or α-glucosidase inhibitors, but less than with sulfonylureas or metformin in unselected patients. When TZDs are added to sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin, an additional 0.8-1.5% HbA1c decline can generally be achieved. Combination forms of metformin and rosiglitazone or pioglitazone are available and may be preferable for some patients due to fewer pills to take or lower co-payment from insurance.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR INSULIN-RESISTANT PATIENTS]
For very insulin-resistant patients with preserved insulin secretion, use of metformin with a TZD can be very effective. Combination pills of metformin and rosiglitazone or pioglitazone may be preferable for some patients. TZD-secretagogue combinations are effective in insulin-resistant patients with moderate insulin secretory reserve. Combination pills are available, both for pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, with glimepiride.
----
[ADOPT TRIAL RESULTS]
The ADOPT trial assessed the durability of glycemic efficacy of glyburide, metformin, and rosiglitazone as monotherapy. The primary study endpoint was the proportion of patients who failed to keep fasting plasma glucose less than 180 mg/dL. The results showed that rosiglitazone had the lowest failure rate, followed by metformin and then glyburide. Weight gain was greater with rosiglitazone, while hypoglycemia was more common with glyburide.
----
[METFORMIN THERAPY]
Metformin is usually the preferred initial treatment selection in most T2DM cases. Data from the UKPDS demonstrate that metformin as monotherapy in overweight patients reduced mortality, myocardial infarction, and weight gain. Long-term follow-up from the UKPDS suggests that this cardiovascular and mortality benefit persists. Metformin is sometimes used in combination with intensive lifestyle modification for prevention of T2DM in patients with pre-diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.
----
[INSULIN SECRETORY FAILURE]
Insulin secretory failure begins before diagnosis and progresses over time, with nearly half of insulin secretion lost at diagnosis. The progressive loss of insulin secretory reserve predicts essentially complete insulin deficiency in about a dozen years if further loss were linear. This decline in β-cell function is a key aspect of type 2 diabetes. According to the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, β-cell function declines gradually and inexorably from the time of diagnosis.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES PROGRESSION]
The natural history of type 2 diabetes mellitus involves a gradual decline in β-cell function, which begins long before diagnosis. Insulin resistance increases during early adulthood, and the initial compensatory increase in insulin secretion eventually fails, causing progression from euglycemia to prediabetes to diabetes. As insulin secretion wanes, post-prandial glucose levels rise, followed by a progressive increase in fasting glucose. This progression requires progressive therapy combinations, with most people with type 2 diabetes eventually requiring basal and meal insulin treatment.

----
[GLITAZONES THERAPY]
Glitazones, also known as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), stimulate the production and circulation of adiponectin, a fat-cell-derived hormone that increases AMPK activity and improves insulin sensitivity. Low adiponectin levels are seen in patients with type 2 diabetes and may contribute to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. However, the use of glitazones as initial therapy is considered less attractive than metformin due to concerns about cardiac safety, with some studies suggesting a increased risk of cardiac events associated with rosiglitazone.

----
[ADIPONECTIN AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY]
Adiponectin is a fat-cell-derived hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Low adiponectin levels are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and may predict a therapeutic response to TZDs. The stimulation of adiponectin production by TZDs may explain some of the beneficial effects of these medications on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Polymorphisms in the PPAR-γ gene may also influence the variability of therapeutic response to TZDs and progression of diabetes.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR DIABETES]
Combination therapies for diabetes have been studied in various trials, including the RECORD study, which compared the addition of rosiglitazone to metformin or sulfonylurea monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular hospitalization or death, and the results showed that rosiglitazone was non-inferior to the control group. However, the study also found an increased risk of heart failure and limb fractures, particularly in women, associated with rosiglitazone use.

----
[ROSIGLITAZONE THERAPY OUTCOMES]
The use of rosiglitazone in diabetes treatment has been associated with an increased risk of heart failure and limb fractures, particularly in women. While the medication has been shown to lower HbA1c levels, its use is not clearly beneficial in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend reserving rosiglitazone for patients who cannot tolerate alternative therapies.

----
[FRACTURE RISK WITH THIAZOLIDINEDIONES]
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), including rosiglitazone, have been linked to an increased risk of long bone fractures in women. The fracture rates were approximately double those of comparator groups, and this risk was seen early and was unrelated to diabetic control. The mechanism of this increased fracture rate is not fully understood, but it may be related to PPAR involvement in osteoblast cell differentiation.

----
[RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ROSIGLITAZONE USE]
Given the adverse event profile and lack of clear cardiovascular benefit, the use of rosiglitazone should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate alternative therapies. This recommendation is in line with current ADA/EASD guidelines, although it is acknowledged that this recommendation may be revised as new evidence emerges. Healthcare providers should carefully consider the risks and benefits of rosiglitazone therapy and monitor patients for potential adverse effects, including fracture risk.
----
[EXENATIDE TREATMENT OUTCOMES]
Exenatide treatment resulted in a significant decline in fasting glucose levels and weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, it was also associated with a higher incidence of nausea and gastrointestinal symptoms compared to placebo or insulin glargine. Despite this, exenatide may be a desirable alternative to basal insulin therapy for patients who are not far from their glycemic goal and need improved weight and glycemia control.

----
[COMPARISON WITH INSULIN GLARGINE]
A study comparing exenatide with insulin glargine found that both treatments resulted in equal reduction of HbA1c levels, but exenatide reduced post-prandial plasma glucose levels more than insulin glargine, while insulin glargine reduced fasting plasma glucose levels more than exenatide. Exenatide also resulted in greater weight loss and lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine.

----
[EXENATIDE AND SULFONYLUREAS]
The use of exenatide with sulfonylureas increases the risk of hypoglycemia, and it may be necessary to reduce sulfonylurea doses to minimize this risk. In patients taking sulfonylureas, it may be appropriate to pre-emptively reduce sulfonylurea doses by half if their lowest blood sugars are less than 100 mg/dL.

----
[EXENATIDE VS BIPHASIC INSULIN ASPART]
A non-inferiority analysis found that exenatide was non-inferior to biphasic insulin aspart in reducing HbA1c levels in patients poorly controlled on metformin and sulfonylureas. Exenatide-treated patients lost weight and had a higher incidence of nausea, while patients treated with biphasic insulin aspart gained weight.

----
[INCRETIN MIMETICS AND COMBINATION THERAPY]
The availability of incretin mimetics, such as exenatide and liraglutide, has opened up new possibilities in combination therapy for type 2 diabetes. These treatments can be used in combination with other medications, such as metformin and sulfonylureas, to improve glycemia control and weight loss.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR DIABETES]
Combination therapies for diabetes, such as adding liraglutide to glimepiride monotherapy, have shown significant reductions in HbA1c levels. Liraglutide, at doses of 1.2 or 1.8 mg, reduced HbA1c levels by -1.1% compared to placebo. Fasting plasma glucose and post-prandial plasma glucose also decreased significantly with liraglutide treatment. 
----
[COMPARISON OF LIRAGLUTIDE WITH OTHER TREATMENTS]
Liraglutide has been compared to other treatments, such as rosiglitazone and exenatide, in clinical trials. Liraglutide showed greater reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose compared to these treatments. Additionally, liraglutide promoted weight loss and had a lower incidence of minor hypoglycemia and nausea compared to exenatide.
----
[EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF LIRAGLUTIDE]
The efficacy and safety of liraglutide have been demonstrated in several clinical trials. Liraglutide has been shown to reduce HbA1c levels, fasting plasma glucose, and post-prandial plasma glucose, while also promoting weight loss. The most common adverse events associated with liraglutide were minor hypoglycemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which were generally mild and transient.
----
[COMPARISON OF LIRAGLUTIDE WITH EXENATIDE]
A head-to-head comparison of liraglutide with exenatide showed that liraglutide had a greater reduction in HbA1c levels and mean fasting plasma glucose. Liraglutide also had a lower incidence of nausea and minor hypoglycemia compared to exenatide. Both treatments promoted similar weight losses, but liraglutide had a more favorable safety profile.
----
[DPP-4 INHIBITORS]
DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, are a class of medications that reduce the degradation of GLP-1 and GIP, resulting in improved glycemic control. In clinical trials, sitagliptin has been shown to reduce HbA1c by 0.6-0.8% when used as monotherapy, and by 0.7% when added to metformin or pioglitazone. DPP-4 inhibitors are weight-neutral and have been found to have a superior effect on peak prandial control compared to preprandial control.
----
[INCRETIN THERAPY]
Incretin therapy, including medications such as exenatide, has been found to have a favorable effect on prandial glycemic control, particularly when HbA1c is near goal. Incretin therapy may also have additional benefits, such as weight loss or minimal weight gain, and may reduce cardiovascular risk by reducing oxidative stress. Exenatide once weekly has been shown to be more effective than exenatide twice daily in reducing HbA1c levels.
----
[COLESEVELAM THERAPY]
Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, has been found to reduce HbA1c by 0.5% when added to metformin or other oral antidiabetic agents. Colesevelam has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on lipid profiles. Further studies have examined the effects of combination therapy with colesevelam and other medications, such as exenatide, in patients with type 2 diabetes.
----
[VILDAGLIPTIN THERAPY]
Vildagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, has been found to be effective in reducing HbA1c levels when added to metformin or other oral antidiabetic agents. In clinical trials, vildagliptin has been shown to reduce HbA1c by 1.0% when added to metformin, and has been found to be non-inferior to other add-on therapies. Vildagliptin has also been shown to improve glycemic control when combined with a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPIES]
Combination insulin and sulfonylurea therapy has been widely studied and provides a basis for many later basal insulin studies. Twice daily therapy, consisting of bedtime insulin and daytime sulfonylurea, was shown to be an effective therapy prior to the widespread use of metformin in the USA. This approach suppressed hepatic glucose output and facilitated the use of sulfonylurea for prandial insulin support. The use of bedtime insulin and daytime sulfonylurea can be an effective combination therapy for diabetes management.

----
[INITIATION OF INSULIN THERAPY]
Initiation of insulin therapy can be performed safely and efficiently with the addition of a basal insulin, such as NPH, glargine, or detemir, with titration of dosage to desired target blood glucose. Several studies and reviews support the safety and effectiveness of this approach. Basal insulin can be used as a single dose or as part of a combination therapy with other diabetes medications.

----
[PRANDIAL DOSING]
Prandial dosing, which involves taking insulin at mealtimes, is an alternative to basal insulin therapy. The APOLLO trial compared basal once daily insulin glargine with three times a day insulin lispro at meals and found similar overall efficacy, but with different patterns of control. The study suggested that either meal insulin or basal insulin can be used to achieve improved control, although patient preference may favor basal insulin due to the convenience of once daily injections.

----
[TRANSITION TO INSULIN THERAPY]
Current consensus guidelines endorse early adoption of insulin therapy, which is often underutilized due to patient and provider hesitance. Attention to patient reluctance and provider barriers can maximize successful initiation of insulin therapy. Providing simple patient titration and addressing concerns about weight gain and hypoglycemia can help facilitate the transition to insulin therapy.
----
[INSULIN THERAPY FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Insulin therapy is eventually needed for most patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). An evening insulin strategy is a simple way to begin insulin therapy that will achieve glycemic goals and is easily understood by patients. This approach addresses a fundamental need in management of T2DM by suppressing overnight endogenous glucose production and thereby preventing hyperglycemia prior to the first meal of the day.

----
[PRE-MIXED INSULIN REGIMENS]
Pre-mixed insulin with the evening meal, such as 70/30 insulin, appears to work better for more obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2). This regimen can achieve a more rapid restoration of glycemic control with self-titration of insulin while continuing oral agents. Studies have shown that pre-mixed insulin regimens can reduce HbA1c levels and improve glycemic control, with some patients achieving better control with twice or thrice daily administration.

----
[COMBINING INSULIN AND ORAL AGENT THERAPY]
Combining insulin and oral agent therapy can be an effective way to manage T2DM. The combination of morning sulfonylureas and suppertime mixed insulin has been shown to achieve better glycemic control than insulin alone. Additionally, the use of pre-mixed rapid analog mixes, such as lispro-neutral protamine lispro (25/75%) and aspart-neutral protamine aspart (30/70%), may also achieve control with more convenient meal timing of insulin.

----
[INSULIN DOSING AND TITRATION]
Insulin dosing and titration are critical components of insulin therapy. Studies have shown that starting with a low dose of insulin, such as 10 units, and titrating weekly can help patients achieve glycemic targets. The goal of titration is to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) equivalent to 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), with adjustments made based on patient response and glycemic control.
----
[INSULIN DETEMIR CHARACTERISTICS]
Insulin detemir is a newer formulation of intermediate- to long-acting insulin with a duration of effect that is dose-dependent, achieving an average duration of action of about 20 hours with a common dosage of 0.4 units/kg. Higher doses can result in a longer duration approaching 24 hours. In a study comparing twice-daily insulin therapy with NPH versus detemir, detemir was found to have comparable glycemic lowering efficacy to NPH with significantly less hypoglycemia.

----
[COMPARISON OF INSULIN DETEMIR AND NPH]
A 24-week study comparing twice-daily administration of insulin detemir and NPH at breakfast and bedtime found that subjects with insulin detemir decreased HbA1c by 1.8% to an average value of 6.8%, while subjects on NPH decreased HbA1c by 1.9% to an average value of 6.6%. Most subjects (about 70%) achieved HbA1c less than 7%, but more subjects on detemir achieved the goal without hypoglycemia.

----
[INSULIN GLARGINE CHARACTERISTICS]
Insulin glargine is another option for starting insulin with an evening injection, offering a longer duration of action than NPH. A 1-year European study found that insulin glargine had similar HbA1c values and insulin dosages compared to NPH, but with significantly less hypoglycemia, including nocturnal hypoglycemia. Glargine also provided better glucose control in the afternoon and evening due to its longer duration of action.

----
[TREAT TO TARGET TRIAL RESULTS]
The Treat to Target Trial compared insulin glargine with NPH insulin at bedtime, finding that both groups were able to achieve a targeted HbA1c of less than 7% in about 60% of patients. The study used a forced weekly titration of dose based on fasting glucose concentration, allowing patients to self-adjust their therapy response to reach the targeted goal.
----
[INSULIN TITRATION]
Patient self-titration is more effective than waiting until the next physician visit, as it involves the patient in their own care. When patients struggle to maintain adequate glycemic control, meal insulin can be added at dinner or the largest meal of the day, starting with a low dose and titrating upward based on 2-hour post-prandial glucose levels. This approach helps to minimize nocturnal hypoglycemia.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY]
The overuse of basal insulin alone can lead to serious hypoglycemia overnight, making it essential to test post-prandial control, especially in patients with a history of overnight or early morning hypoglycemia. A unit-for-unit trade-off between meal insulin and basal insulin can help minimize nocturnal hypoglycemia, as increasing meal insulin requires a corresponding decrease in basal insulin.

----
[INSULIN TYPES]
Detemir insulin can be administered once in the evening or twice daily, offering desirable features such as a lower rate of hypoglycemia, greater consistency in glycemic response, and possibly reduced weight gain. This makes it a suitable option for patients with a high BMI, such as those with an average BMI of over 29 kg/m2.

----
[INITIATING INSULIN TREATMENT]
Recent studies have explored the best way to initiate insulin treatment, comparing the strategy of basal insulin only to the alternative of basal and prandial insulin. The optimal manner of initiating insulin treatment is crucial to achieving effective glycemic control and minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia and other complications.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR DIABETES]
Combination therapies for diabetes have been studied extensively, with research focusing on the effectiveness of combining different medications, such as insulin, glimepiride, and metformin, to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that combination therapies can be effective in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes. For example, the DIGAMI study found that intensive insulin treatment improved long-term survival in patients with diabetes mellitus and acute myocardial infarction.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Glycemic control is crucial in managing diabetes, as poor control can lead to cardiovascular mortality and other complications. Research has highlighted the importance of targeting postprandial hyperglycemia, with studies showing that insulinotropic agents can be effective in reducing postprandial blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, lifestyle interventions and medications such as metformin have been shown to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes.

----
[MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF DIABETES MEDICATIONS]
The mechanisms of action of diabetes medications, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), have been studied extensively. PPARs have been shown to have pleiotropic actions in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, making them a potential target for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Medications such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly when used in combination with other medications such as sulfonylureas and metformin.

----
[CLINICAL TRIALS AND STUDIES]
Numerous clinical trials and studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different combination therapies for diabetes. These studies have provided valuable insights into the benefits and risks of different treatment approaches, including the use of intensive glucose control and combination therapies. For example, the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study Group found that intensive glucose lowering in type 2 diabetes had significant effects on cardiovascular outcomes.
----
[EXENATIDE TREATMENT]
Exenatide is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes, and studies have shown its efficacy in improving glycemic control when added to metformin and a sulfonylurea. In a 30-week study, exenatide was found to have a significant effect on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, exenatide has been compared to insulin glargine and biphasic insulin aspart in patients with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes, with results showing its non-inferiority.

----
[LIRAGLUTIDE TREATMENT]
Liraglutide is a human GLP-1 analogue that has been shown to improve glycemic and weight control in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a 26-week study, liraglutide was found to produce greater improvements in glycemic and weight control compared to adding rosiglitazone or placebo in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide has also been studied in combination with metformin and TZD, with results showing its efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

----
[COMPARISON OF EXENATIDE AND LIRAGLUTIDE]
A 26-week randomized, parallel-group, multinational, open-label trial compared liraglutide once a day to exenatide twice a day for type 2 diabetes, with results showing the efficacy and safety of both treatments. Another study compared exenatide once weekly to twice daily, with results showing the non-inferiority of the once-weekly regimen.

----
[DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-IV INHIBITORS]
Vildagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor, has been shown to improve meal-related beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes over 1 year. This class of medications has been found to be effective and tolerable in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Combination therapies for type 2 diabetes have been studied in various clinical trials, which have shown that adding insulin to oral hypoglycemic agents can improve glycemic control. Bedtime insulin regimens, such as insulin glargine, have been compared to other regimens, including NPH insulin, and have been found to have benefits such as less nocturnal hypoglycemia and better post-dinner glucose control. These studies suggest that combination therapies can be an effective approach for managing type 2 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN REGIMENS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Different insulin regimens have been compared in clinical trials, including once-daily basal insulin glargine versus thrice-daily prandial insulin lispro, and biphasic insulin aspart 70/30. These studies have shown that different regimens can have varying effects on glycemic control and hypoglycemia risk. For example, insulin glargine has been found to have a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared to NPH insulin. These findings can inform the development of personalized insulin regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[INITIATION OF INSULIN THERAPY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The initiation of insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes is an important topic, and several studies have investigated the best approach. A rational approach to starting insulin therapy involves considering factors such as the patient's current glycemic control, lifestyle, and preferences. Clinical trials have also compared different insulin regimens and found that a treat-to-target approach can be effective in achieving glycemic goals. These findings can help healthcare providers make informed decisions about insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[COMPARISON OF INSULIN ANALOGS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Several studies have compared the effects of different insulin analogs, including insulin detemir and insulin glargine, in patients with type 2 diabetes. These studies have found that insulin detemir can improve glycemic control with less hypoglycemia and no weight gain, compared to NPH insulin. Other studies have compared the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of insulin detemir and found it to have a favorable profile. These findings can inform the choice of insulin analog for patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF INSULIN REGIMENS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The long-term efficacy of insulin regimens in type 2 diabetes has been investigated in several studies, including the 4-T study. This study found that complex insulin regimens can be effective in achieving glycemic goals over a period of three years. Other studies have also found that insulin therapy can be sustained over time, with benefits for glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors. These findings can help healthcare providers make informed decisions about long-term insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIABETES PREVALENCE IN HOSPITALS]
The prevalence of diabetes in hospital inpatients is estimated to be between 12% and 24% in the USA, with a significant proportion of these cases being undiagnosed or having stress hyperglycemia. The global burden of diagnosed diabetes is expected to increase by 20% in Europe and by 65-98% in less economically developed countries by 2030. This has significant implications for hospital care, with people with diabetes spending approximately 1.34 million days in hospital each year. The cost of caring for inpatients with diabetes is substantial, estimated at around £485 million per year in the UK.

----
[UNDIAGNOSED DIABETES AND STRESS HYPERGLYCEMIA]
In addition to diagnosed diabetes, there are two other groups of patients with hyperglycemia in hospitals: those with unrecognized diabetes and those with "hospital-related" hyperglycemia. Unrecognized diabetes occurs when patients have a raised plasma glucose level without a diagnosis of diabetes, and "hospital-related" hyperglycemia refers to fasting plasma glucose levels above 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or random levels above 198 mg/dL (11 mmol/L). These conditions can have significant implications for patient care and outcomes.

----
[HOSPITAL CARE FOR DIABETES PATIENTS]
Hospital inpatients with diabetes often have multiple comorbidities and complex medical and nursing requirements, requiring highly skilled and trained staff to manage their care safely and effectively. However, ward-based staff are frequently poorly trained, which can compromise patient safety and lead to errors in insulin and diabetes management. Structured diabetes care delivered by trained staff and supported by a dedicated specialist inpatient team can improve patient experience, reduce errors, and shorten hospital stays.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT AND CARE PLANNING]
Patients with diabetes undergoing surgery should have a preoperative assessment, a robust risk assessment, and an individualized care plan, including a safe and effective discharge plan. This is crucial to ensure optimal outcomes and minimize complications. Patients with diabetes are more likely to undergo in-hospital procedures and should be managed according to agreed and audited protocols.

----
[STANDARDS OF CARE FOR DIABETES PATIENTS]
Professional organizations have defined standards of care for hospital inpatients with diabetes, but these standards are not globally implemented. Audit of inpatient care reveals poor standards of care and patient experience, demonstrating the inadequacy of present systems and processes. Improving the quality of care for diabetes patients in hospitals is essential to reduce errors, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN CARDIAC SURGERY]
Patients with hyperglycemia undergoing cardiac surgery can benefit from intravenous infusion titrated to normoglycemia for 3 days postoperatively, which has been shown to improve mortality, reduce deep sternal wound infections, and shorten length of stay. This is based on the Portland Diabetic Project, a non-randomized observational study of 5510 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study highlights the importance of managing hyperglycemia in cardiac surgery patients.

----
[INTENSIVE INSULIN THERAPY IN CRITICAL CARE]
Intensive insulin therapy (IIT) has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients in the surgical intensive treatment unit (ITU), but randomized trials have yielded inconsistent effects on mortality and increased rates of severe hypoglycemia. A recent meta-analysis of 26 trials involving 13,567 patients found that IIT compared with conventional therapy had a pooled relative risk of death of 0.93, but also increased the risk of severe hypoglycemia. The targets of IIT did not influence either mortality or risk of hypoglycemia.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HYPERGLYCEMIA IN ACUTE ILLNESS]
Stress-induced hyperglycemia in acute illness is caused by the combined effects of hormonal, cytokine, and counter-regulatory nervous system signals on glucose metabolic pathways. This leads to increased secretion of counter-regulatory hormones, which stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and inhibits peripheral uptake of glucose. Severe hyperglycemia can result in osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances, as well as a generalized catabolic state.

----
[EVIDENCE OF HARM FROM IN-HOSPITAL HYPERGLYCEMIA]
There is compelling evidence that poorly controlled blood glucose levels are associated with higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality, prolonged length of stay, unfavorable post-discharge outcomes, and significant excess healthcare costs. Patients with new hyperglycemia or known diabetes have been shown to have increased in-hospital mortality compared with normoglycemic patients, highlighting the importance of managing hyperglycemia in the hospital setting.
----
[DIABETES CARE PLANS]
Individual plans for diabetes care should include discharge and follow-up, access to a multidisciplinary team, and laboratory procedures. These plans aim to promote self-management of diabetes and prevent patient disempowerment. Patients should be empowered to self-manage their glucose monitoring, food choices, and insulin administration where appropriate.
----
[GENERAL WARD CARE]
In general ward care, patients with diabetes should be assessed for glycemic control and metabolic and vascular risk. Staff should be aware of the special risks associated with diabetes, such as new ulceration, cardiac risk, and renal failure. Patients should be managed according to a strict glycemic protocol to avoid hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
----
[CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS]
Critically ill patients with diabetes should be managed according to a strict glycemic protocol, with glucose levels kept below 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) and an active avoidance of hypoglycemia. This protocol aims to minimize the risks associated with hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in critically ill patients.
----
[GLYCEMIC TARGETS]
Glycemic targets for patients with diabetes vary depending on the clinical setting. For example, the Canadian guidelines recommend glucose levels of 6.1 mmol/L in post-surgical ITU patients and 128-180 mg/dL (7.1-10 mmol/L) in peri-myocardial infarction patients. These targets aim to balance the risks of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
----
[DIABETES AND STRESS]
Stress can increase the release of inflammatory mediators, leading to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), can enhance hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, leading to hyperglycemia.
----
[HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Hospital-acquired hyperglycemia can be caused by various factors, including co-administered medications such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Immobility, infection, and other hospital-related factors can also contribute to hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES HOSPITALIZATION RISKS]
Patients with diabetes are twice as likely to be admitted to hospital and stay twice as long in a hospital bed, often due to diabetes mismanagement secondary to poor staff knowledge and lack of education. Involvement of specialist diabetes teams and diabetes inpatient specialist nurses can significantly reduce length of stay and insulin errors, improving the patient experience. Good communication between patients, diabetes specialists, and non-specialist teams is crucial to activate timely intervention and avoid glycemic deterioration during hospital stay.

----
[DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT IN HOSPITAL]
Patients with diabetes are often accustomed to managing their own diabetes, but may be disempowered in the hospital setting. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and Diabetes UK highlight the importance of educating patients to deliver safe self-care in the hospital setting, and individuals suitable for self-management in hospital must be competent adults with a stable level of consciousness who successfully manage their diabetes at home. Patients must also have the physical skills to self-administer insulin, perform self-monitoring of blood glucose, and have adequate oral intake.

----
[DIABETES CARE DELIVERY BARRIERS]
Systems failures can be a barrier to safe and effective diabetes care delivery in hospital, and it is essential that patients with diabetes are identified and flagged at an early stage of the admission process. The ADA recommends that all patients admitted to hospital should be identified in the medical record as having diabetes, and the UK NHS has standards in place to ensure effective care of diabetes in hospital, including involving patients in decisions concerning their diabetes management.

----
[DIABETES SUPPORT AND RESOURCES]
The National Diabetes Support Group (NHS Diabetes) and Diabetes UK have produced documents and resources to improve diabetes inpatient services, including a commissioning toolkit and a patient guide entitled "What care to expect in hospital". These resources aim to empower patients and improve the quality of diabetes care in hospital, and can be used to support patients and healthcare professionals in delivering effective diabetes care.
----
[INSULIN TREATMENT RISKS]
Insulin treatment in hospitals can be life-saving, but it also has the potential to be life-threatening due to its narrow therapeutic index. Insulin has been identified as one of the top five high-risk medications in the inpatient environment, with errors occurring at any stage of prescribing, preparing, and delivering the medication. The potential consequences of error can be catastrophic, with one-third of all inpatient medical errors that cause death within 48 hours involving insulin administration.

----
[MEDICAL STAFF EDUCATION]
There is a need for appropriate medical staff education in diabetes and insulin treatment to reduce errors. Endocrinologists can play a key role in educating junior doctors, who should be taught the principles of drug dosage and prescription writing before starting their ward placements. Despite revised curricula and new education models, insulin prescribing errors in junior hospital doctors remain a concern.

----
[NON-MEDICAL PRESCRIBING]
In the UK, legislation for nurse prescribing was implemented in 2003, with nurse prescribers receiving more training hours than medical students. However, the quality of care for diabetes patients can be compromised due to systems failure, poor coding, and inadequate information systems technology. Routine blood glucose screening for all hospital inpatients is not standard practice in the UK, making it difficult to identify patients with undiagnosed diabetes and stress hyperglycemia.

----
[WARD ENVIRONMENT FACTORS]
The hospital environment can contribute to the difficulty of managing inpatient diabetes, with factors such as intercurrent illness, changes to a patient's usual regimen, and unpredictable test and procedure schedules leading to glycemic instability. Patients' dietary intake may also be erratic due to poor appetite, food palatability, or timely delivery, making basic diabetes care challenging to deliver.

----
[STAFF TRAINING CHALLENGES]
In the UK, qualified staff numbers have been reduced, and ward staff have limited protected time for education and training beyond mandatory topics. This can hinder the ability of staff to provide adequate diabetes care and management, highlighting the need for prioritized education and training in diabetes care.
----
[DIABETES SPECIALIST NURSES]
Diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs) play a crucial role in delivering patient-centered care to individuals with diabetes in various care settings. They support inpatients and ward staff, and their role has evolved to focus on clinical care, medical and nursing education, and guideline production. DSNs can significantly reduce inpatient length of stay and, with non-medical prescribing skills, can also reduce insulin and diabetes management errors.

----
[DIABETES SPECIALIST DIETITIANS]
Diabetes specialist dietitians have a pivotal role in caring for diabetic inpatients with complex nutritional needs, particularly those who are unable to swallow or require a complex dietary regimen. They work with patients who have conditions such as renal failure, cystic fibrosis, and elderly patients with unique nutritional requirements.

----
[DIABETES MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS]
Diabetes inpatient teams are multidisciplinary, consisting of healthcare professionals with specialist skills who provide a holistic approach to patient care. The team includes diabetes specialist nurses, dietitians, ward-based diabetes link nurses, and diabetes specialist pharmacists, all working together to deliver effective diabetes care.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF IN-HOSPITAL HYPERGLYCEMIA]
All hospitals should have a policy for glycemic management and blood glucose monitoring in place, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) or National Institute for Health standards. Hyperglycemia is a common problem in hospitals, occurring in around 25% of all hospital inpatients, and poor glycemic control is common among inpatients with diabetes. Hospitals should prioritize glycemic management to improve patient outcomes.

----
[PATIENT REFERRAL TO DIABETES SPECIALIST TEAMS]
Given the high prevalence of diabetes among inpatients, specialist teams have developed priority lists for patient referrals. While all patients with diabetes should have access to specialist services, in reality, teams must prioritize those with the greatest need. Referral criteria documents, such as the one from Leicester, UK, can guide the referral process.
----
[INSULIN INFUSION IN HOSPITAL SETTINGS]
Intravenous infusion of insulin is the only insulin treatment strategy specifically developed for use in the hospital setting, and it is recommended by the American College of Endocrinologists for controlling glycemia in certain indications. The ideal insulin protocol should be safe, understandable, and easily implemented, with an algorithm for making incremental changes to the infusion rate. This approach can help improve the efficacy of the protocol and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

----
[PREVENTING HYPOGLYCEMIA WITH INSULIN INFUSION]
To prevent hypoglycemia, intravenous insulin infusions should be supported by caloric input, which can be provided through a simultaneous infusion of dextrose or other routes such as enteral or parenteral nutrition. If hypoglycemia develops despite adequate caloric provision, the patient should be treated promptly according to local protocol, and the insulin infusion adjusted accordingly.

----
[IMPLEMENTING INSULIN INFUSION PROTOCOLS]
Successful implementation of an insulin infusion protocol requires a multidisciplinary team approach, led by a champion, and a widespread educational program for medical, nursing, and pharmacy staff. Adherence to a standard protocol can help reduce adverse events and medical errors in insulin prescribing, and regular audit of adverse incidents can help identify areas for improvement.

----
[INDICATIONS FOR INTRAVENOUS INSULIN INFUSION]
Intravenous insulin infusion is indicated for patients with hyperglycemic emergencies, acute coronary syndromes, severe or repeated hypoglycemia, and new diagnosis of diabetes, among other conditions. The American College of Endocrinologists provides guidelines for the use of intravenous insulin infusion in these situations, and hospitals should have protocols in place to ensure safe and effective use of this treatment strategy.

----
[DIABETES CARE IN HOSPITAL SETTINGS]
Systemic problems can create obstacles to appropriate and safe care of patients receiving insulin in hospital, including poorly defined management plans, lack of therapeutic adjustment, and fear of provoking hypoglycemia. To address these issues, hospitals should implement safeguards to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, ensure patient safety, and provide additional training for ward staff.
----
[INSULIN ADMINISTRATION DURING HOSPITAL STAY]
When switching from IV to subcutaneous insulin, it's best to do so at the patient's usual insulin administration time, before a meal. Patients with type 1 diabetes will become insulin deficient quickly after IV infusion is stopped, so it's recommended to continue the infusion for 1 hour after subcutaneous insulin is administered. This allows time for the insulin to be absorbed. If the patient has an established insulin regimen, it should be restarted, but doses may need to be adjusted based on the patient's clinical condition.

----
[PREPARATION AND DELIVERY OF INSULIN INFUSION]
The insulin infusion is prepared by adding 50 units of soluble insulin to 49.5 mL of normal saline, providing 1 unit of insulin per 1 mL of saline. This is delivered via an infusion pump and can be combined with a dextrose infusion using a three-way connector and non-return valve. All patients should start with algorithm A and adjust to achieve target glucose range.

----
[TARGETS FOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
The AACE/ADA recommends maintaining blood glucose levels between 140-180 mg/dL (7.8-10 mmol/L) once intravenous insulin has been started, with potential benefits at the lower end of this range. Targets should not fall below 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), and lower targets may be beneficial in specific groups, but more evidence is needed to make firm recommendations.

----
[CONVERSION TO SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN]
Conversion from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin should be delayed until patients can eat and drink normally without nausea or emesis. The usual time to switch is at the patient's usual insulin administration time, before a meal, and the IV infusion should be continued for 1 hour after subcutaneous insulin is administered to allow for absorption.

----
[ESTIMATING INSULIN DOSE]
For patients being converted from intravenous insulin infusion, the total daily dose (TDD) of insulin can be estimated by calculating the average hourly insulin dose over the last 6 hours and multiplying by a factor of 20. This can help guide the transition to subcutaneous insulin therapy.
----
[DEFINING IN-HOSPITAL HYPOGLYCEMIA]
In-hospital hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose level equal to or below 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and is associated with significant morbidity and potentially fatal complications. Acute hypoglycemia can cause an intense hemodynamic response leading to cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents, coma, and death. It is essential to detect and manage hypoglycemia promptly to prevent these complications.
----
[CAUSES OF IN-HOSPITAL HYPOGLYCEMIA]
In-hospital hypoglycemia can occur due to various reasons, including insulin administration and prescribing errors, and inappropriate food administration. These causes are often related to insulin therapy and can be prevented with proper management and education. Understanding the causes of hypoglycemia is crucial for effective prevention and treatment.
----
[MANAGEMENT OF IN-HOSPITAL HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The management of in-hospital hypoglycemia involves prompt assessment and treatment, with guidelines available for each ward and outpatient setting. Patients with diabetes should be encouraged to self-manage hypoglycemic events when capable and appropriate, and their capacity to do so should be recorded in their patient notes. Treatment options include GlucoGel, glucagon, and intravenous glucose infusion, depending on the patient's condition and response to treatment.
----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Treatment options for hypoglycemia include administering 1.5-2 tubes of GlucoGel or 1 mg of glucagon intramuscularly if the patient is able to swallow, and monitoring blood glucose levels after 15 minutes. If the patient is unconscious or uncooperative, treatments such as quick-acting carbohydrates or intravenous glucose infusion may be considered. It is essential to repeat capillary blood glucose measurements and adjust treatment accordingly to ensure the patient's blood glucose levels return to normal.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA TREATMENT]
Mild hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes can be treated with 15-20g of quick-acting carbohydrate, and blood glucose levels should be tested after 15 minutes. If the level is still less than 4 mmol/L, the treatment can be repeated up to three times. If the patient is unable to swallow, 1.5-2 tubes of GlucoGel or 1mg of Glucagon IM can be given. 
----
[SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT]
For severe hypoglycemia, especially in patients who are unconscious, fitting, or very aggressive, IV glucose infusion at 100 ml/hr can be given until the patient is no longer nil by mouth (NBM) or reviewed by a doctor. It is essential to continue regular capillary blood glucose monitoring for 24 to 48 hours and provide hypoglycemia education or refer to a diabetes specialist nurse for advice.
----
[DIABETES AND SURGERY]
Patients with diabetes are more likely to undergo surgery due to poorer overall health, with an estimated 50% requiring surgery in their lifetime. Diabetes increases the risk of perioperative infection, postoperative cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality. The complex interplay of surgery, anesthesia, fasting, and postoperative factors contributes to labile glycemic control in the perioperative period.
----
[METABOLIC RESPONSE TO SURGERY]
Surgery and anesthesia cause a state of relative insulin hyposecretion and insulin resistance, leading to a complex series of hormonal and metabolic changes. The secretion of counter-regulatory or "stress" hormones, such as cortisol and catecholamines, increases, resulting in decreased insulin sensitivity and hyperglycemia. The magnitude of this response varies among individuals and is greater with prolonged surgery and post-operative sepsis.
----
[PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION]
Preoperative evaluation is crucial for patients with diabetes, especially since most patients are admitted on the same day as scheduled surgery. Pre-assessment planning is essential to ensure optimal glycemic control and minimize the risks associated with surgery in patients with diabetes.
----
[PREOPERATIVE DIABETES CARE]
Patients with diabetes should receive written information about changes in diabetes-specific medication before surgery, and their awareness and knowledge of all drug therapy should be assessed. Basic investigations, including HbA1c levels, should be conducted to identify potential risks, such as postoperative infections associated with elevated levels over 7% (>53 mmol/mol). Effective pre-assessment of people with diabetes enables safe and effective discharge from hospital.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT PLAN]
The diabetes management plan should be discussed with the patient during the pre-assessment visit, enabling them to make informed decisions about their care. The plan should include optimization of glycemic control, and further appointments should be offered if necessary. All recommendations for treatment should be written in the patient's notes and in a handheld record kept by the patient.

----
[SAME-DAY ADMISSIONS AND PREPARATIONS]
High-risk patients with diabetes are not suitable for same-day admission and should be admitted the day before surgery for assessment and optimization of glycemic control. Elevated preoperative glucose levels >200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) have been associated with deep wound infections, and plans should be in place for rapid optimization of glycemic control if necessary.

----
[ASSESSING CARDIAC RISK]
Patients with diabetes require careful assessment due to their high risk of coronary heart disease, which is sometimes asymptomatic. A robust risk assessment with a focus on cardiopulmonary risk should be conducted, considering the risk associated with the procedure and the individual patient's risk associated with pre-existing co-morbidities. Cardiac risk stratification indexes, such as the Goldmann cardiac risk index, can be used to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk of a major cardiac event during or after surgery.
----
[INTRAOPERATIVE GLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT]
Intraoperative management of glycemia in patients with diabetes involves the use of an IV insulin infusion to control blood glucose levels. This method allows for easy titration and has been shown to be safe in many studies. Close monitoring of blood glucose and potassium levels is required, as well as interpretation by well-trained staff. 
----
[INTRAVENOUS INSULIN INFUSION TYPES]
There is no superior type of insulin infusion for surgery in terms of safety or effectiveness. Commonly used regimens include variable rate separate insulin and glucose intravenous infusions, and glucose, insulin, and potassium infusion. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, including flexibility and potential wastefulness.
----
[POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND DISCHARGE]
Postoperative care for patients with diabetes involves reinstating preoperative diabetes treatment once the patient is eating well, or keeping them on IV insulin infusion with appropriate fluid replacement for major surgery. Conversion to normal therapy should occur when the patient is eating, drinking, and free from nausea and emesis. Hyperalimentation may be introduced for patients with prolonged periods of nil by mouth or who are severely unwell.
----
[INDIVIDUAL INTRAOPERATIVE DIABETES CARE TREATMENT PLAN]
Management of individual patients with diabetes during surgery is determined by factors such as the severity and nature of surgery, duration of perioperative fast, timing of surgery, and pre-existing diabetes treatment. A personalized treatment plan should be developed based on these factors, taking into account the need for dextrose and insulin infusion for major surgery.
----
[GOALS OF GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT]
The primary goals of perioperative diabetes care are to avoid marked hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Patients with type 1 diabetes require exogenous insulin, and careful management is necessary to achieve these goals and ensure optimal outcomes.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS]
Glycemic control is crucial in hospitalized patients with diabetes to reduce the risk of infectious complications and improve outcomes. Studies have shown that hyperglycemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes, particularly in those with community-acquired pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction. Effective glycemic control can be achieved through intensive insulin therapy, which has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients.

----
[INTENSIVE INSULIN THERAPY IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS]
Intensive insulin therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia. This approach involves tight blood glucose control, typically using intravenous insulin, to maintain blood glucose levels within a target range. Studies have demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy can reduce the risk of nosocomial infections, organ failure, and death in critically ill patients.

----
[GUIDELINES FOR INPATIENT GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
The International Diabetes Federation recommends that hospitals have protocols in place to support glycemic control in hospitalized patients with diabetes. This includes having a structured approach to blood glucose monitoring, insulin therapy, and adjustment of treatment regimens as needed to achieve target blood glucose levels. Effective implementation of these protocols can help improve outcomes and reduce the risk of complications in hospitalized patients with diabetes.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA AND INFECTION RISK]
Hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of infection in patients with diabetes, particularly in those with community-acquired pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction. Studies have shown that hyperglycemia can impair immune function and increase the risk of infectious complications, highlighting the importance of effective glycemic control in hospitalized patients with diabetes.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION]
Insulin therapy has been shown to have beneficial effects on endothelial function, including increasing nitric oxide synthase activity in human aortic endothelial cells. This may help to improve vascular function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN HOSPITALS]
In-hospital treatment and surgery for patients with diabetes require careful management to prevent errors in insulin therapy and ensure safe and effective use of insulin. Studies have shown that a systems approach to reducing errors in insulin therapy can be effective in the inpatient setting. Additionally, identifying clinically significant preventable adverse drug events through a hospital's database of adverse drug reaction reports can help improve patient safety.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY SAFETY]
The safe and effective use of insulin in secondary care is crucial for treating hyperglycemia in adults. Recommendations for insulin therapy in hospitals include using a standardized approach to insulin administration and monitoring blood glucose levels regularly. A quality improvement initiative can help reduce insulin medication errors and improve patient outcomes.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT]
Detection, prevention, and treatment of hypoglycemia in the hospital are critical to preventing adverse events. A practical aid, such as a "HYPOBOX," can help manage hypoglycemia in hospital settings. Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk of hypoglycemia and take steps to prevent and treat it promptly.

----
[PERIOPERATIVE CARE]
Perioperative care for patients with diabetes requires careful planning and management to maintain normal insulin sensitivity after surgery. Studies have shown that perioperative insulin and glucose infusion can help maintain normal insulin sensitivity. Guidelines for perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery are also available to help healthcare providers manage patients with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES CARE GUIDELINES]
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Diabetes Association have issued a consensus statement on inpatient diabetes glycemic control. This statement provides guidelines for healthcare providers to manage diabetes in the hospital setting and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, organizations such as Diabetes UK have developed resources to help healthcare providers improve diabetes care in hospitals.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA DEFINITION]
Hypoglycemia in diabetes is the result of therapeutic hyperinsulinemia, which occurs during treatment with an insulin secretagogue or with insulin. It is a limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes, causing recurrent morbidity in most people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and many with advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hypoglycemia can be fatal and compromises physiologic and behavioral defenses against subsequent falling plasma glucose concentrations.

----
[PHYSIOLOGIC DEFENSES]
The key physiologic defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations are decrements in insulin and increments in glucagon and epinephrine. The behavioral defense is carbohydrate ingestion prompted by symptoms that are largely the result of sympathetic neural activation. However, in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), these defenses are lost due to β-cell failure.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA UNAWARENESS]
Hypoglycemia unawareness is a condition where the body no longer responds to low blood sugar levels, and it is largely brought about by attenuated increments in sympathetic neural activity. This condition, as well as defective glucose counter-regulation, can be caused by recent antecedent hypoglycemia, prior exercise, or sleep, which attenuates the sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia.

----
[RISK FACTORS FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The risk factors for hypoglycemia include relative or absolute therapeutic insulin excess, absolute endogenous insulin deficiency, a history of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, prior exercise or sleep, and aggressive glycemic therapy. These factors contribute to the increased incidence of iatrogenic hypoglycemia over time in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), approaching that in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

----
[PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT]
Minimizing the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia requires acknowledging the problem, applying the principles of aggressive glycemic therapy, and considering the risk factors for relative or absolute therapeutic insulin excess and hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF). Maintenance of the greatest degree of glycemic control that can be accomplished safely in a given patient is in the patient's best interest, and concerns about hypoglycemia should not be an excuse for poor glycemic control.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA DEFINITION]
Hypoglycemia is a condition where the blood glucose levels fall below the normal range, causing functional brain failure if left untreated. The brain requires a continuous supply of glucose from the circulation, and hypoglycemia can lead to cognitive impairments, behavioral changes, and psychomotor abnormalities. In severe cases, hypoglycemia can cause seizure and coma. The symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia are not specific and can only be confirmed by Whipple's triad.

----
[GLUCOSE REGULATION]
The body maintains systemic glucose balance through the dynamic regulation of endogenous glucose production from the liver and kidneys, and glucose utilization by non-neural tissues such as muscle. This regulation is primarily controlled by insulin, which plays a crucial role in preventing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The liver and kidneys produce glucose, while non-neural tissues utilize glucose, and insulin helps to balance these processes.

----
[RESPONSES TO HYPOGLYCEMIA]
When plasma glucose concentrations fall, the body responds with a sequence of reactions, including a decrease in insulin secretion, an increase in the secretion of glucose counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon and epinephrine, and a sympathoadrenal response. These responses help to raise blood glucose levels and prevent hypoglycemia. As plasma glucose concentrations continue to fall, the responses become more intense, leading to symptoms such as cognitive impairments, behavioral changes, and psychomotor abnormalities.

----
[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia can be categorized into two types: neuroglycopenic and neurogenic. Neuroglycopenic symptoms result from brain glucose deprivation and include cognitive impairments, behavioral changes, and psychomotor abnormalities. Neurogenic symptoms, on the other hand, are caused by the perception of physiologic changes triggered by hypoglycemia and include adrenergic and cholinergic symptoms such as palpitations, tremulousness, and sweating.
----
[PHYSIOLOGIC DEFENSES AGAINST HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The body has three main physiologic defenses against hypoglycemia: withdrawal of insulin, increase in pancreatic islet α-cell glucagon secretion, and increase in adrenomedullary epinephrine secretion. These defenses help raise plasma glucose concentrations and prevent hypoglycemia. The increase in glucagon secretion stimulates hepatic glucose production, while the increase in epinephrine secretion raises plasma glucose concentrations by stimulating hepatic and renal glucose production.
----
[GLUCAGON SECRETION]
Glucagon secretion is signaled primarily by a decrease in intra-islet insulin in the setting of low glucose concentrations, and secondarily by increased autonomic nervous system inputs. Increased glucagon secretion stimulates hepatic glucose production, largely by stimulating glycogenolysis. This defense mechanism becomes critical when glucagon is deficient.
----
[EPINEPHRINE SECRETION]
Epinephrine secretion is the third physiologic defense against hypoglycemia, and it becomes critical when glucagon is deficient. Epinephrine raises plasma glucose concentrations largely by β2-adrenergic stimulation of hepatic and renal glucose production, and also involves limitation of glucose clearance by insulin-sensitive tissues.
----
[SYMPATHOADRENAL ACTIVITY REGULATION]
Sympathoadrenal activity, including epinephrine secretion, is regulated in the brain. Circulating epinephrine is almost exclusively derived from the adrenal medulla, while circulating norepinephrine is largely derived from sympathetic nerves under resting and many stimulated conditions.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA DEFENSE MECHANISMS]
The body's defense mechanisms against hypoglycemia include the release of epinephrine, glucagon, and insulin. However, in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and advanced type 2 diabetes (T2DM), these mechanisms are compromised, leading to a increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. The attenuated epinephrine response is a key factor in the development of defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA UNAWARENESS]
Hypoglycemia unawareness is a condition where individuals do not experience the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as sweating and tremors, due to reduced release of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and acetylcholine. This condition is associated with a sixfold increased risk of severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia in T1DM. Recent antecedent hypoglycemia, prior exercise, or sleep can also contribute to hypoglycemia unawareness.

----
[GLUCOSE COUNTERREGULATION PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
The pathophysiology of glucose counterregulation is similar in T1DM and advanced T2DM, although the time course may differ. Therapeutic hyperinsulinemia can lead to falling plasma glucose concentrations, resulting in loss of insulin and glucagon responses, and ultimately, compromised glycemic defenses. This can lead to the development of defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA-ASSOCIATED AUTONOMIC FAILURE]
Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is a concept that suggests recent antecedent hypoglycemia, prior exercise, or sleep can cause defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness. This is due to the attenuation of epinephrine responses to subsequent hypoglycemia, leading to a more intense sympathoadrenal response and neurogenic symptoms.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA AWARENESS]
Hypoglycemia awareness can be improved by scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia, which reverses hypoglycemia unawareness and improves the attenuated epinephrine component of defective glucose counter-regulation in most affected patients. People with advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are also at risk for hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF). Glucagon responses to hypoglycemia are lost in T2DM, similar to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). 
----
[CAUSES OF HAAF]
There are three recognized causes of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF): antecedent hypoglycemia-related HAAF, exercise-related HAAF, and sleep-related HAAF. Antecedent hypoglycemia-related HAAF leads to attenuated sympathoadrenal and symptomatic responses to hypoglycemia. Exercise-related HAAF is exemplified by late post-exercise hypoglycemia, which typically occurs 6-15 hours after strenuous exercise and is often nocturnal. 
----
[CLINICAL IMPACT OF HAAF]
The clinical impact of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is well established in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Recent antecedent hypoglycemia reduces epinephrine, symptomatic, and cognitive dysfunction responses to a given level of subsequent hypoglycemia, reduces detection of hypoglycemia in the clinical setting, and reduces defense against hyperinsulinemia in T1DM. Avoiding hypoglycemia for as little as 2-3 weeks can improve hypoglycemia awareness and reduce the risk of HAAF. 
----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HAAF]
Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is a dynamic functional disorder that is distinct from classic diabetic autonomic neuropathy. The key feature of HAAF is an attenuated sympathoadrenal response to a given level of hypoglycemia, which is more prominent in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. HAAF leads to a vicious cycle of recurrent iatrogenic hypoglycemia, making it a critical aspect of diabetes management.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA SYMPTOMS]
Hypoglycemia in diabetes can cause various symptoms, including neuroglycopenic symptoms, such as confusion and drowsiness, and neurogenic symptoms, such as palpitations and sweating. The severity and type of symptoms can vary depending on the individual and the level of blood glucose. Symptoms can occur at different blood glucose levels, with some people experiencing symptoms at higher levels than others.

----
[GLUCOSE AND HORMONE RESPONSES]
During hyperinsulinemic stepped hypoglycemic glucose clamps, patients with type 1 diabetes exhibit changes in plasma glucose, insulin, epinephrine, and glucagon concentrations. The body's response to hypoglycemia involves the release of hormones such as epinephrine and glucagon to help raise blood glucose levels. Insulin levels also play a crucial role in glucose regulation during hypoglycemia.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA AND HYPOGLYCEMIA COMPARISON]
Comparing mornings following afternoon hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, patients with type 1 diabetes exhibit different symptom profiles and hormone responses. The body's response to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can vary, with differences in symptom severity and hormone release. Understanding these differences is essential for effective diabetes management.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS]
Effective management of diabetes requires an understanding of the body's response to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, including symptom recognition and hormone regulation. By recognizing the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, individuals with diabetes can take steps to prevent and treat these conditions, improving overall diabetes management and reducing the risk of complications.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA-ASSOCIATED AUTONOMIC FAILURE]
Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is a condition where the body's autonomic nervous system fails to respond properly to low blood glucose levels, leading to defective glucose counter-regulation and hypoglycemia unawareness. This condition can occur in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and advanced type 2 diabetes (T2DM) due to β-cell failure. HAAF can cause individuals to be less likely to be awakened by hypoglycemia, making it a significant concern for diabetes management.
----
[MECHANISMS OF HAAF]
The mechanisms of HAAF involve the loss of insulin and glucagon responses to falling plasma glucose concentrations, which is caused by β-cell failure in T1DM and advanced T2DM. Attenuated sympathoadrenal responses also play a role in HAAF, leading to defective glucose counter-regulation and hypoglycemia unawareness. The exact mechanism of the attenuated sympathoadrenal response is not known, but it is thought to occur at the level of the brain or the sympathoadrenal system.
----
[RESEARCH ON HAAF]
Research into the pathogenesis of HAAF has focused on the hypothalamus, which is the central integrator of the sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycemia. While the primary alteration could reside in the hypothalamus, changes in hypothalamic function could also be secondary to changes in other brain regions. Studies have used measurements of regional cerebral blood flow to investigate the mechanisms of HAAF.
----
[CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF HAAF]
HAAF has significant clinical implications for individuals with diabetes, as it can increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness. Avoiding hypoglycemia is crucial in preventing HAAF, and strict glucose control can help to reduce the risk of this condition. Understanding the mechanisms of HAAF is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent and manage this condition in individuals with diabetes.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK FACTORS]
The risk factors for hypoglycemia in diabetes include absolute or relative therapeutic insulin excess, compromised physiologic and behavioral defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations, and hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF). Absolute therapeutic insulin excess occurs when insulin doses are excessive, ill-timed, or of the wrong type, while relative therapeutic insulin excess occurs when exogenous glucose delivery is decreased, glucose utilization is increased, or endogenous glucose production is decreased. These factors can lead to iatrogenic hypoglycemia, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and advanced type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA-ASSOCIATED AUTONOMIC FAILURE]
Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is a condition where the body's autonomic response to hypoglycemia is impaired, leading to reduced sympathoadrenal and symptomatic responses. This can occur due to recent antecedent hypoglycemia, prior exercise, sleep, and aggressive glycemic therapy. HAAF can cause a greater increase in synaptic activity in the dorsal midline thalamus during subsequent hypoglycemia, potentially leading to thalamic inhibition of hypothalamic activity.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The pathophysiology of glucose counter-regulation plays a crucial role in the development of hypoglycemia in diabetes. When plasma glucose concentrations fall, the body's physiologic defenses against hypoglycemia are triggered, including the release of glucagon and epinephrine. However, in individuals with diabetes, these defenses can be compromised, leading to an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Understanding the pathophysiology of glucose counter-regulation is essential for managing and preventing hypoglycemia in individuals with diabetes.

----
[CONVENTIONAL RISK FACTORS FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Conventional risk factors for hypoglycemia in diabetes include absolute or relative therapeutic insulin excess, as outlined in Table 33.3. These factors include excessive or ill-timed insulin doses, decreased exogenous glucose delivery, increased glucose utilization, decreased endogenous glucose production, and increased sensitivity to insulin. Individuals with diabetes and their caregivers must consider these risk factors when managing diabetes treatment to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.

[HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK FACTORS]
The risk factors for hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) include absolute endogenous insulin deficiency, a history of severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, recent antecedent hypoglycemia, prior exercise or sleep, and aggressive glycemic therapy. These factors contribute to the compromised defenses against hypoglycemia, making it a significant concern for individuals with diabetes. The degree of endogenous insulin deficiency determines the extent to which insulin levels will not decrease and glucagon levels will not increase as plasma glucose concentrations fall.

----
[CLINICAL PROBLEM OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Hypoglycemia is a major clinical problem in diabetes, affecting most individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and many with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The prevalence of diabetes is increasing, with an estimated rise from 285 million people in 2009 to 435 million people by 2030. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is a significant barrier to maintaining euglycemia over a lifetime of diabetes, ultimately affecting all people with diabetes.

----
[FREQUENCY OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in individuals with T1DM, with the average patient experiencing two episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia per week and one or more episodes of severe, temporarily disabling hypoglycemia per year. This problem has not abated since it was highlighted by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in 1993, with some studies reporting an incidence of severe hypoglycemia that is twice or even fivefold higher than that in the DCCT.

----
[EVENT RATES FOR SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The event rates for severe hypoglycemia, requiring the assistance of another person, vary depending on the study and population. For example, the UK Hypoglycemia Study Group reported an incidence of severe hypoglycemia that was twice that in the DCCT in patients with T1DM for < 5 years and an incidence fivefold higher than that in the DCCT in those with T1DM for > 15 years. Similar rates have been reported in other studies, highlighting the significance of hypoglycemia as a clinical problem in diabetes.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA MORTALITY RATES]
Hypoglycemia is a significant cause of mortality in people with diabetes, with reported mortality rates ranging from 2-10% in individuals with Type 1 diabetes. Similar data is not available for Type 2 diabetes, but mortality rates of up to 10% have been reported during episodes of severe sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. The exact cause of excess mortality during intensive glycemic therapy is not known, but hypoglycemia is considered a plausible cause.
----
[DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) defines hypoglycemia in diabetes as all episodes of abnormally low plasma glucose concentration that expose the individual to potential harm. The ADA recommends that people with drug-treated diabetes become concerned about the possibility of developing hypoglycemia at a plasma glucose concentration of ≤ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). This value is considered a conservative alert threshold to reduce glycemic defenses against subsequent hypoglycemia.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia increases substantially in individuals with advanced Type 2 diabetes, approaching that of Type 1 diabetes. Severe hypoglycemia prevalences of 7% and 25% and incidences of 10 and 70 episodes per 100 patient-years have been reported in individuals with Type 2 diabetes treated with insulin for more than 5 years. Asymptomatic episodes of hypoglycemia are often missed, and symptomatic episodes may not be recognized or remembered.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA SYMPTOMS AND GLYCEMIC THRESHOLDS]
Symptoms of hypoglycemia typically develop at a plasma glucose concentration of approximately 50-55 mg/dL (2.8-3.1 mmol/L) in individuals without diabetes. However, the glycemic threshold for symptoms shifts to lower plasma glucose concentrations in people with tightly controlled diabetes and recurrent hypoglycemia, and to higher plasma glucose concentrations in those with poorly controlled diabetes.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Addressing hypoglycemia is crucial in diabetes care, as it can be a barrier to glycemic control. Patient concerns about hypoglycemia can hinder treatment, and it is essential to acknowledge and address the issue in every contact with people with diabetes. Caregivers should review the principles of aggressive glycemic therapy and apply them to individual patients. 
----
[PRINCIPLES OF AGGRESSIVE GLYCEMIC THERAPY]
The principles of aggressive glycemic therapy include diabetes self-management based on patient education and empowerment, frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose, flexible and appropriate insulin regimens, individualized glycemic goals, and ongoing professional guidance and support. Patient education and empowerment are fundamentally important, especially as the therapeutic regimen becomes more complex. 
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA EDUCATION AND EMPOWERMENT]
People with insulin secretagogue or insulin-treated diabetes need to be taught about hypoglycemia, including common symptoms, individual symptoms, and how to treat an episode. Close associates also need to be educated on hypoglycemia to provide support and assistance when needed. Education on hypoglycemia is crucial for effective glycemic management. 
----
[DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The American Diabetes Association Workgroup recommends a clinical classification of hypoglycemia, which includes severe hypoglycemia as an event requiring assistance from another person to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. A plasma glucose cutoff value of ≤ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is recommended as a generic alert value for hypoglycemia. 
----
[PREVENTION OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Prevention of hypoglycemia involves reducing hypoglycemia risk factors, which can be achieved through a four-step approach. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia can be lowered in individual patients with diabetes by practicing hypoglycemia risk factor reduction, which is essential for effective glycemic control.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK FACTORS]
Hypoglycemia can occur when certain diabetes medications, such as insulin secretagogues, are used with insulin. The risk of hypoglycemia is higher with longer-acting sulfonylureas like glibenclamide compared to shorter-acting ones like glimepiride. Additionally, factors like missed meals, exercise, and alcohol ingestion can contribute to hypoglycemia. 
----
[INSULIN THERAPY AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The use of long-acting insulin analogs, such as glargine or detemir, can reduce the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Rapid-acting analogs, like lispro or aspart, can also reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia when used as prandial insulin in a multiple daily injection regimen.
----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND COMPLICATIONS]
Partial glycemic control can reduce the development of microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, maintaining euglycemia over a lifetime is ideal but often not achievable due to the risk of hypoglycemia. 
----
[INDIVIDUALIZED GLYCEMIC GOALS]
Glycemic goals should be individualized and may need to be adjusted over time due to progression of insulin deficiency, development of co-morbid illnesses, or other factors. The goal is to achieve a HbA1c level as close to the non-diabetic range as possible while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia.
----
[DIABETES EDUCATION AND HYPOGLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT]
Patients with diabetes need to be educated on the symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia, how to administer glucagon, and the conventional risk factors for hypoglycemia, including the effects of their medications, missed meals, exercise, and alcohol ingestion.
----
[GLUCAGON TREATMENT FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Glucagon can be used to treat hypoglycemia, but it is ineffective in individuals with depleted glycogen stores, such as those who have recently ingested a large amount of alcohol. Smaller doses of glucagon, repeated if necessary, can be effective without causing side effects. Intravenous glucose is the standard parenteral therapy for hypoglycemia, with a common initial dose of 25g.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA DURATION AND CAUSE]
The duration of an episode of iatrogenic hypoglycemia depends on its cause, with episodes caused by rapid-acting insulin secretagogues or analogs being relatively brief, and those caused by long-acting sulfonylureas or insulin analogs being substantially longer. The latter can result in prolonged hypoglycemia requiring hospitalization.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Maintaining the lowest mean glycemia that can be accomplished safely is in the best interest of people with diabetes, although it is not possible to maintain euglycemia over a lifetime of diabetes due to the risk of hypoglycemia. People with diabetes and their caregivers should keep the problem of iatrogenic hypoglycemia in perspective, as early in the course of type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia may respond to lifestyle changes or glucose-lowering drugs without causing hypoglycemia.

----
[INDIVIDUALIZED GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
The glycemic management of diabetes is empirical, and caregivers should work with each individual patient to find the most effective and safest method of glycemic control at a given point in the course of their diabetes. Care is best accomplished by a team that includes professionals trained in translating standards of care into individualized patient care, using modern communication and computing technologies.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA DEFINITION]
Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood glucose levels, which can occur in people with diabetes. The prevention and correction of hypoglycemia are crucial in diabetes management. According to research, the glycemic thresholds for activation of glucose counterregulatory systems are higher than the threshold for symptoms. 

----
[CAUSES OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The causes of hypoglycemia in diabetes are complex and involve the autonomic nervous system, glucagon secretion, and insulin deficiency. In people with insulin-dependent diabetes, the inability to secrete insulin can lead to enhanced glycemic responsiveness to epinephrine, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. 

----
[SYMPTOMS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The symptoms of hypoglycemia are largely the result of sympathetic neural activation, rather than adrenomedullary activation, and can include neurogenic symptoms such as hunger, sweating, and trembling. The perception of these symptoms is crucial for the awareness of hypoglycemia, and research has shown that the mechanism of awareness of hypoglycemia involves the perception of neurogenic rather than neuroglycopenic symptoms. 

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA IN TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
The challenge of managing hypoglycemia is greater in people with advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) due to compromised defenses against falling plasma glucose. Research has identified type 1 diabetic patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia during intensive therapy, and a reliable test for adequate glucose counterregulation in type 1 diabetes mellitus has been developed.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA AWARENESS]
Restoration of hypoglycemia awareness in patients with long-duration insulin-dependent diabetes is possible with rational, intensive therapy. Studies have shown that institution of such therapy can lead to long-term recovery from unawareness, deficient counterregulation, and lack of cognitive dysfunction during hypoglycemia. This is crucial for patients with type 1 diabetes, as impaired awareness of hypoglycemia can have severe consequences.

----
[EXERCISE AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, can affect glucose and counterregulatory hormone concentrations in children with type 1 diabetes. Post-exercise late-onset hypoglycemia is a common phenomenon in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, and understanding its mechanisms is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. Research has also explored the effects of exercise on glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetes.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA-ASSOCIATED AUTONOMIC FAILURE]
Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is a condition where the body's autonomic response to hypoglycemia is impaired, leading to reduced awareness of hypoglycemia and increased risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes. The mechanisms of HAAF involve complex interactions between the brain, pancreas, and autonomic nervous system, and research has identified several key factors contributing to its development.

----
[RISK FACTORS FOR SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Several risk factors for severe hypoglycemia have been identified in adult patients with type 1 diabetes, including impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, previous history of severe hypoglycemia, and poor glycemic control. Understanding these risk factors is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies to reduce the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in this population.

----
[PREVALENCE OF IMPAIRED AWARENESS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia is a common phenomenon in adults with type 1 diabetes, affecting a significant proportion of patients. This condition can have severe consequences, including increased risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes, and highlights the need for effective screening and treatment strategies to restore hypoglycemia awareness in affected patients.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA IN DIABETES]
Hypoglycemia is a significant concern in diabetes management, with various studies investigating its frequency, symptoms, and risk factors in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Research has shown that hypoglycemia can occur in patients treated with insulin, sulfonylurea, metformin, or diet therapy. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and other studies have provided valuable insights into the management of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA FREQUENCY AND SYMPTOMS]
The frequency and symptoms of hypoglycemia can vary among patients with type 2 diabetes, with some studies reporting a higher frequency of severe hypoglycemia in patients treated with insulin. Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include impaired awareness, which can increase the risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes. Studies have also investigated the frequency of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes, highlighting the need for careful management and monitoring.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Insulin therapy is a common treatment for type 2 diabetes, but it can increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Research has compared the frequency of hypoglycemia in patients treated with different insulin regimens, including bedtime insulin and multiple dose insulin. The use of implantable insulin pumps has also been investigated as a potential means of reducing hypoglycemic episodes.

----
[RISK FACTORS FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Several risk factors have been identified as contributing to the development of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients, including the type and duration of diabetes, the presence of other medical conditions, and the use of certain medications. Studies have also investigated the impact of intensive insulin therapy on the progression of diabetic microvascular complications, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the benefits and risks of different treatment approaches.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT AND EDUCATION]
Effective management and education are critical in preventing and treating hypoglycemia in diabetic patients. This includes educating patients on the recognition of hypoglycemic symptoms, the use of glucose monitoring devices, and the importance of timely treatment. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in providing patients with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage hypoglycemia and prevent severe episodes.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT]
Hypoglycemia is a significant concern in diabetes management, and several studies have investigated its prevention and treatment. Research has shown that hypoglycemia can be a barrier to achieving good glycemic control, and that fear of hypoglycemia can be a significant issue for patients with type 1 diabetes. Effective management of hypoglycemia is crucial to prevent severe episodes and improve overall diabetes control.

----
[CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING]
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to be an effective tool in improving diabetes management, particularly in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Studies have demonstrated that CGM can help improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia. The accuracy of CGM systems, such as the FreeStyle Navigator, has been validated in several studies.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA AWARENESS]
Hypoglycemia awareness is critical for patients with diabetes, and several studies have investigated the factors that influence awareness of hypoglycemia. Research has shown that fear of hypoglycemia can be a significant issue for patients with type 1 diabetes, and that hypoglycemia anticipation, awareness, and treatment training (HAATT) can reduce the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia.

----
[RISK ASSESSMENT FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Assessing the risk of severe hypoglycemia is an important aspect of diabetes management. The Low Blood Glucose Index has been validated as a tool for assessing the risk of severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. Algorithmic evaluation of metabolic control and risk of severe hypoglycemia using self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) data has also been shown to be effective.
----
[INTRODUCTION TO HYPOGLYCEMIA IN DIABETES]
Hypoglycemia is a critical aspect of diabetes care, and various studies have investigated its causes, effects, and treatment. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) are notable examples of research that have shaped our understanding of diabetes management. These studies have explored the relationship between glycemic control and the risk of complications in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Glycemic control is essential in preventing complications associated with diabetes. Intensive glucose control has been shown to reduce the risk of microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association has established standards of medical care in diabetes, including guidelines for glycemic control, to help healthcare providers manage the condition effectively.

----
[TREATMENT OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
The treatment of hypoglycemia involves administering glucose or glucagon to raise blood glucose levels. Various studies have investigated the use of different agents, such as alanine and terbutaline, in the treatment of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Additionally, mini-dose glucagon rescue has been shown to be effective in treating hypoglycemia in children with type 1 diabetes.

----
[ROLE OF CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING]
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) plays a crucial role in diabetes management, particularly in detecting hypoglycemia. Real-time CGM systems can alert patients to potential hypoglycemic episodes, enabling them to take prompt action to prevent or treat the condition. This technology has been shown to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

----
[COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL MEDICATIONS]
Oral medications, such as sulfonylureas and metformin, are commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. Studies have compared the effectiveness and safety of these agents, highlighting their potential benefits and risks. For example, sulfonylureas have been shown to uncouple the glucose dependence of the insulinotropic effect of glucagon-like peptide-1, while metformin has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

----
[RISK OF HYPOGLYCEMIA WITH ORAL ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
Oral antidiabetic agents, particularly sulfonylureas, can increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. The risk of hypoglycemia varies depending on the specific agent, dose, and patient characteristics. Healthcare providers should carefully consider these factors when selecting oral medications for patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN ANALOGUES AND HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Insulin analogues, such as long-acting insulin analogues, have been developed to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. These agents have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia and improving quality of life in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, their use should be carefully considered, and patients should be educated on their proper use and potential risks.
----
[DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS DEFINITION]
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious medical emergency characterized by a lack of insulin, leading to a high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis caused by an excess of ketoacids. The classic signs of DKA include polyuria, polydipsia, rapid weight loss, weakness, Kussmaul respiration, drowsiness, and rarely, coma. The diagnosis of DKA is made when the pH is below the normal range and the levels of ketoacids in the blood or urine are markedly elevated. Treatment involves rehydration, IV insulin, and potassium supplementation.

----
[DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS TREATMENT]
The cornerstones of DKA treatment are rehydration, IV insulin, and potassium supplementation. Intravenous insulin administration should continue until the acidosis is normalized, not merely until euglycemia is achieved. Aggressive treatment is necessary to prevent serious complications and improve outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of DKA are critical to reducing morbidity and mortality.

----
[HYPEROSMOLAR NON-KETOTIC HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia (HH) is characterized by hyperosmolality with progressive hyperglycemia and an effective serum osmolality of >320 mOsm/kg. This condition typically affects elderly patients with type 2 diabetes and is often precipitated by infection or cardiovascular disease. Treatment involves aggressive rehydration and IV insulin, similar to DKA. The distinction between DKA and HH is not always obvious on clinical grounds, but treatment generally follows the same principles.

----
[MORTALITY RATES AND TRENDS]
Mortality rates for DKA and HH have been declining over the past few years, with current rates of around 5% for DKA and 10-15% for HH. The decline in mortality may be due to a combination of factors, including lower incidence, earlier diagnosis, improved treatment, and better education and self-monitoring. Improved education schedules, self-monitoring, and the use of standardized low-dose insulin regimens have contributed to this favorable trend.
----
[DIABETES KETOACIDOSIS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is caused by insulin deficiency, which leads to uncontrolled lipolysis and ketogenesis, resulting in increased plasma glucose and ketone bodies. Insulin deficiency can be relative, such as in the setting of severe infection, or absolute, when insulin therapy is neglected. This deficiency can also cause increased breakdown of body protein, contributing to ketosis and hyperglycemia. 
----
[INSULIN AND INFLAMMATION]
Insulin has anti-inflammatory properties, particularly in critically ill patients, and administration of exogenous insulin may increase insulin sensitivity and break the vicious circle of hyperglycemia and cytokine release. Insulin's anti-inflammatory effects can help mitigate the negative impacts of cytokines, such as TNF-α, which can impair insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.
----
[LIPID METABOLISM IN DKA]
Contrary to popular belief, deranged lipid metabolism, rather than carbohydrate metabolism, is the main cause of DKA. Uncontrolled lipolysis in adipose tissue and ketogenesis in the liver lead to the development of DKA. Lipolysis is tightly controlled by lipases, but low insulin levels and stress hormones, such as epinephrine and cortisol, can stimulate lipolysis and increase blood concentrations of free fatty acids.
----
[DKA INCIDENCE AND PATHOGENESIS]
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes, with an estimated 2-8% of hospital admissions in children with diabetes resulting from DKA. The annual incidence rate of DKA in children is around 5 per 1000 patients. Insulin deficiency, whether relative or absolute, is the primary cause of DKA, and can lead to increased breakdown of body protein, contributing to ketosis and hyperglycemia.
----
[STRESS HORMONES AND CYTOKINES IN DKA]
Stress hormones, such as glucagon, epinephrine, growth hormone, and cortisol, play a significant role in the development of DKA. These hormones can be triggered by cytokines, dehydration, hypotension, and hypoperfusion, and can contribute to the metabolic responses to infection, including hyperthermia and stress hormone release. Cytokine levels are often elevated in DKA, even in the absence of infection, and can impair insulin sensitivity and contribute to the development of DKA.
----
[DIABETES PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
In individuals with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM), the body's inability to produce insulin leads to hyperglycemia, which is caused by a combination of lack of insulin and an excess of stress hormones, resulting in insulin resistance. This insulin resistance increases gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose production in the liver. Hyperglycemia is usually present in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), but it can also occur with normal or moderately elevated glucose concentrations, particularly during caloric deprivation.

----
[DKA AND KETONE BODIES]
Ketone bodies, such as 3-hydroxybutyrate, are ancient fuel compounds that provide energy for the brain and other tissues during fasting, prolonged exercise, and other conditions of fuel shortage. In DKA, ketogenesis becomes uncontrolled, and circulating levels of ketone bodies rise rapidly and excessively due to increased supply of fatty acids to the liver and low levels of insulin and high levels of glucagon. This unrestrained process is normally prevented by compensatory mechanisms in healthy individuals.

----
[INSULIN DEFICIENCY AND KETONE PRODUCTION]
Severe insulin deficiency, such as in Type 1 diabetes, can lead to increased lipolysis and ketone production. The lack of insulin, combined with high levels of counter-regulatory hormones like catecholamines and cortisol, promotes ketogenesis and increases the production of ketone bodies. This can result in the development of DKA, a serious complication of diabetes that requires prompt medical attention.

----
[EVOLUTIONARY ROLE OF KETONE BODIES]
Ketone bodies have played an important role in evolution, providing energy for the brain and other tissues during times of fuel shortage. They are present in primitive species and have been a vital source of energy for over 2-3 billion years. Understanding the physiological role of ketone bodies can provide insights into the development of DKA and the importance of insulin in regulating glucose and ketone metabolism.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DKA]
Prompt diagnosis and initial treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) rely on careful clinical examination, determination of plasma glucose, measurement of ketones in blood or urine, measurement of plasma potassium and other electrolytes, and assessment of acidemia. If glucose is high and blood or urine ketones are markedly elevated, DKA is likely, and fluid and insulin therapy can usually be initiated. The diagnostic criteria for DKA are outlined in Table 34.1, which guides healthcare professionals in making an accurate diagnosis.

----
[LABORATORY TESTS FOR DKA]
The next diagnostic steps for DKA usually include arterial blood gas analysis, blood electrolytes (including anion gap), serum lactate, complete blood cell count, biochemical assessment of liver and renal function, blood and urine cultures, myocardial biomarkers, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest X-ray. Modern gas analyzers can provide potassium concentrations, and bedside ketone body monitors can quickly and reliably measure 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in blood.

----
[POTASSIUM LEVELS IN DKA]
Despite potassium depletion, serum potassium is typically normal or elevated in DKA patients due to water deficiency and an intracellular to extracellular shift caused by insulin deficiency and acidemia. Patients with low potassium levels have a severe total body potassium deficiency and should receive vigorous replacement therapy guided by cardiac monitoring. Potassium supplementation must be given prior to insulin therapy if potassium levels are very low.

----
[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES FOR DKA]
Differential diagnoses for DKA include all other causes of acidosis, such as starvation ketosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, and intoxication with salicylate, methanol, ethylene glycol, and paraldehyde. A high anion gap and varying degrees of respiratory compensation characterize DKA, and measures of ketone body concentrations and arterial gas analysis are crucial for diagnosis. Clinical history can help identify starvation ketosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis.

----
[PRECIPITATING FACTORS FOR DKA]
In patients with known diabetes, DKA is usually precipitated by a coexisting illness or omission of insulin therapy. Infection is the most common precipitating factor, and other factors can contribute to the development of DKA. Understanding these precipitating factors is essential for preventing and managing DKA in patients with diabetes.
----
[INSULIN THERAPY FOR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS]
Insulin therapy for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) should be adjusted based on hourly measurements of blood glucose and blood ketones, aiming for a gradual decline in both. The initial decline is largely caused by rehydration and expansion of the extracellular volume. Insulin should be given at least every hour, regardless of the prevailing blood glucose level. 

----
[GLUCOSE ADMINISTRATION]
When glucose concentrations are 10-15 mmol/L, glucose should be given IV and/or orally to avoid hypoglycemia. It is usually possible to taper IV insulin treatment when 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations are well below 3 mmol/L. Ten percent glucose should be used for IV replacement as it provides some extra anabolic substrate.

----
[POTASSIUM REPLACEMENT]
Potassium replacement is crucial in DKA, as the body is typically depleted of potassium. Although initial potassium values may be normal or elevated, insulin therapy, rehydration, and correction of acidosis can cause a decrease in serum potassium. Potassium administration should be guided by frequent concentration measurements, with 20-30 mmol potassium/hour administered once potassium levels are below 5.0 mmol/L.

----
[BICARBONATE USE]
The use of bicarbonate in DKA is a matter of controversy, but it is empirically recommended that 25-50 mmol sodium bicarbonate be given hourly for 1-2 hours if the pH is below 7.0. This should be done with caution and careful monitoring of the patient's condition.

----
[PHOSPHATE SUPPLEMENTATION]
Phosphate deficiency is typically present in DKA, but there is no evidence that phosphate supplementation should be given routinely. However, in patients with severe hypophosphatemia and/or cardiac and skeletal or respiratory muscle weakness, 20-30 mmol potassium phosphate can be given hourly for 1-2 hours.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS]
The management of DKA rests on four pillars: fluid and electrolyte therapy, IV insulin therapy, treatment of co-morbidities, and careful monitoring of the clinical course. Treatment should be initiated without delay, and the patient should be monitored frequently and carefully, preferably in a highly specialized unit. Severe cases should be treated and monitored in an intensive care unit where possible.
----
[HYPEROSMOLAR HYPERGLYCEMIA]
Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia (HH) is a serious complication of diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality, often occurring in frail patients with other life-threatening conditions. The condition is typically precipitated by infectious diseases or cardiovascular events, and symptoms of hyperglycemia are usually present for several days. HH is caused by a vicious cycle of relative insulin deficiency, high stress hormone levels, and impaired glucose utilization, leading to severe dehydration and hyperosmolality.
----
[CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF HH]
Patients with HH often present with severe dehydration, poor skin turgor, altered level of consciousness, and signs of hypovolemic shock. Diagnostic procedures are similar to those for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with patients typically having a water deficit of 10-20% of body weight and sodium, chloride, and potassium deficits of 5-10 mmol/kg body weight.
----
[TREATMENT OF HH]
Treatment of HH follows similar guidelines to DKA, aiming to correct hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, and water and electrolyte deficits over 24 hours. Patients are generally sensitive to insulin, and an infusion of 0.1 IU/kg body weight/hour is often adequate. Rehydration with isotonic saline is typically started with 1 L in the first hour, followed by slower rehydration. Hemodynamic performance should be carefully monitored, and potassium administration should follow the same guidelines as for DKA.
----
[COMORBIDITIES AND COMPLICATIONS]
Coexisting diseases, such as infectious diseases and cardiovascular events, can precipitate HH and DKA. Common complications of HH and DKA include iatrogenic hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and recurrence of the condition. Preventable complications can be avoided with rapid analysis of glucose and potassium, as well as a competent and experienced medical team.
----
[DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS TREATMENT]
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that requires prompt treatment. Low-dose insulin therapy has been shown to be effective in treating diabetic ketoacidosis, and intensive insulin therapy can exert anti-inflammatory effects in critically ill patients. The use of insulin therapy can also counteract the adverse effects of low mannose-binding lectin levels. Additionally, intensive insulin therapy has been found to protect the endothelium of critically ill patients.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIC CRISES]
Hyperglycemic crises, including diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, are life-threatening conditions that require immediate medical attention. The mortality rate from hyperglycemic crises has been declining over the years, thanks to advances in medical treatment and care. Predictors of intensive care unit and hospital length of stay in diabetic ketoacidosis include the severity of the condition and the presence of underlying health complications.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY EFFECTS]
Insulin therapy has been found to have anti-inflammatory effects in critically ill patients, and can protect the endothelium and improve insulin sensitivity. Intensive insulin therapy can also exert beneficial effects on protein, glucose, and lipid metabolism in patients with hyperglycemic crises. Furthermore, insulin therapy can help to reduce the risk of myocardial injury and biomarker elevation in patients with diabetes.

----
[METABOLIC DERANGEMENTS]
Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by metabolic derangements, including impaired glucose and lipid metabolism. The condition can be triggered by factors such as insulin deficiency, infection, and dehydration. Short-term fasting can also contribute to the development of euglycemic ketoacidosis during periods of insulin deficiency. Understanding the metabolic derangements that occur in diabetic ketoacidosis is crucial for the development of effective treatment strategies.

----
[RESEARCH AND STUDIES]
Numerous studies have investigated the treatment and management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic crises. These studies have provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of these conditions and have informed the development of evidence-based treatment guidelines. Further research is needed to continue to improve our understanding of these conditions and to develop more effective treatment strategies.
----
[DIABETES MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Microvascular complications in diabetes are caused by prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia, which damages cell types that cannot downregulate glucose uptake, leading to intracellular hyperglycemia. This damage occurs through five major mechanisms, including increased flux of glucose through the polyol pathway and increased formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). A single process, increased mitochondrial production of oxygen free radicals, activates these mechanisms. Hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial superoxide production may also explain the continuing progression of tissue damage after improvement of glycemic levels.

----
[MECHANISMS OF MICROVASCULAR DAMAGE]
The mechanisms of microvascular damage in diabetes include increased intracellular formation of AGEs, activation of protein kinase C isoforms, and overactivity of the hexosamine pathway. Additionally, hypertension accelerates microvascular damage by increasing intracellular hyperglycemia through upregulation of the glucose transporter 1. Hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production also impairs the neovascular response to ischemia.

----
[DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS OVERVIEW]
Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia, a relative or absolute lack of insulin action, and the development of diabetes-specific pathology in the retina, renal glomerulus, and peripheral nerve. This leads to accelerated atherosclerotic disease, making diabetes the leading cause of new blindness and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the developed world. Diabetes also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) three- to eightfold, with over 40% of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (MI) having diabetes.

[IMPACT OF CHRONIC DIABETES ON MICROVASCULATION]
Chronic diabetes has a significant impact on the microcirculation, with long-standing disease leading to progressive narrowing and eventual occlusion of vascular lumina, resulting in impaired perfusion, ischemia, and dysfunction of the affected tissues. Increased vascular permeability is one of the earliest processes contributing to microvascular occlusion, allowing extravasation of plasma proteins that accumulate as periodic acid-Schiff-positive material.
----
[DIABETES MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Microvascular complications in diabetes are caused by prolonged exposure to high glucose levels, leading to increased intracellular formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, and overactivity of the hexosamine pathway. These mechanisms contribute to the progressive narrowing and blockage of diabetic microvascular lumina, accompanied by loss of microvascular cells. The polyol pathway also plays a role in microvascular damage, with increased flux of glucose and other sugars contributing to vessel wall thickening and microthrombus formation.

----
[ROLE OF HYPERGLYCEMIA IN MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Hyperglycemia is the primary cause of diabetic microvascular complications, as established by large-scale prospective studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study (DCCT/EDIC) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). Prolonged exposure to high glucose levels damages specific cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, due to their failure to downregulate glucose uptake when extracellular glucose concentrations are elevated. This leads to intracellular hyperglycemia and subsequent damage to these cells.

----
[MECHANISMS OF HYPERGLYCEMIA-INDUCED DAMAGE]
There are five major mechanisms by which hyperglycemia causes diabetic complications, including increased flux of glucose and other sugars through the polyol pathway, increased expression of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and its activating ligands, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, and overactivity of the hexosamine pathway. These mechanisms contribute to the development of microvascular complications, including vessel wall thickening, microthrombus formation, and loss of microvascular cells.

----
[CELL-SPECIFIC DAMAGE IN DIABETES]
The targeting of specific cell types by generalized hyperglycemia reflects the failure of those cells to downregulate their uptake of glucose when extracellular glucose concentrations are elevated. Cells that are not directly susceptible to direct hyperglycemic damage, such as vascular smooth muscle, show an inverse relationship between extracellular glucose concentrations and glucose transport. In contrast, vascular endothelial cells, a major target of hyperglycemic damage, show no significant change in glucose transport rate when glucose concentration is elevated, resulting in intracellular hyperglycemia.
----
[ALDOSE REDUCTASE AND DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
Aldose reductase is an enzyme that plays a role in the development of microvascular complications in diabetes. Studies have shown that overexpression of aldose reductase in diabetic mice leads to increased atherosclerosis and reduced expression of genes that regulate regeneration of glutathione (GSH). Decreased GSH levels have been observed in the lens of diabetic rats and transgenic mice that overexpress aldose reductase. 
----
[GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND ALDOSE REDUCTASE]
In diabetic vascular cells, glucose is not the primary substrate for aldose reductase due to its low affinity for the enzyme. Instead, glycolytic metabolites of glucose such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate may be the physiologically relevant substrate for aldose reductase. The Michaelis constant (Km) of aldose reductase for glucose is 100 mmol/L, which is much higher than the intracellular concentration of glucose in diabetic retina.
----
[ADVANCED GLYCOSYLATION END-PRODUCTS (AGEs)]
AGEs are formed through the reaction of glucose and other glycating compounds with proteins and nucleic acids, leading to irreversible changes that impair the structural, enzymatic, or signaling functions of the glycated proteins. AGEs are found in increased amounts in diabetic tissues and are a familiar example of this process, yielding glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).
----
[THE POLYOL PATHWAY]
The polyol pathway is a metabolic pathway that involves the conversion of glucose to sorbitol by aldose reductase, using NADPH as a cofactor. The first and rate-limiting step of the polyol pathway is governed by aldose reductase, which is found in tissues such as nerve, retina, lens, glomerulus, and blood vessel wall. Hyperglycemia-induced increases in polyol pathway flux can damage tissues through various mechanisms, including sorbitol-induced osmotic stress and decreased cytosolic NADPH.
----
[MECHANISMS OF TISSUE DAMAGE]
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how hyperglycemia-induced increases in polyol pathway flux could damage tissues. These include sorbitol-induced osmotic stress, decreased cytosolic Na/K+ - ATPase activity, increased cytosolic NADH/NAD+, and decreased cytosolic NADPH. However, it is now clear that sorbitol levels in diabetic vessels and nerves are far too low to cause osmotic damage.
----
[FORMATION OF ADVANCED GLYCOSYLATION END-PRODUCTS (AGEs)]
Advanced Glycosylation End-products (AGEs) are formed through the reaction of reactive intracellular dicarbonyls with uncharged amino groups of intracellular and extracellular proteins. Methylglyoxal is the major intracellular AGE precursor, and its formation can lead to the modification of proteins, altering their function. This process can damage cells and contribute to the development of microvascular complications in diabetes.

----
[MECHANISMS OF AGE-INDUCED CELL DAMAGE]
Intracellular production of AGE precursors can damage cells through three general mechanisms: altering the function of intracellular proteins, disrupting the interaction between extracellular matrix components and matrix receptors, and inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the binding of modified plasma proteins to AGE receptors on cells. This can lead to multiple pathologic changes in gene expression, contributing to the development of diabetic complications.

----
[ROLE OF AGEs IN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
AGE modification of intracellular proteins has been implicated in the development of diabetic retinopathy. High glucose levels can induce the expression of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), a factor that regulates retinal capillary formation, leading to endothelial cell death and vessel regression. AGEs can also modify the corepressor mSin3A, resulting in increased expression of Ang-2 and contributing to the development of retinopathy.

----
[EFFECTS OF AGEs ON EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX]
AGE formation can alter the functional properties of extracellular matrix molecules, such as collagen and laminin. This can lead to the expansion of molecular packing, inhibition of normal lateral association, and interference with binding of non-collagenous domains, ultimately contributing to the development of microvascular complications in diabetes.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
The pathogenesis of microvascular complications in diabetes involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of NF κ B, and p21 ras. Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) play a key role in this process by binding to their receptor, RAGE, and inducing procoagulatory changes and increased vascular permeability. This leads to the development of complications such as diabetic neuropathy and atherosclerosis.

----
[AGE SIGNALING PATHWAY]
AGE signaling can be blocked by expressing RAGE antisense cDNA or anti-RAGE ribozyme, which can help prevent the development of microvascular complications. The RAGE-NF κ B axis operates in diabetic neuropathy, mediating functional sensory deficits. Additionally, AGE binding to RAGE alters the expression of several genes, including thrombomodulin, tissue factor, and VCAM-1, leading to procoagulatory changes and increased adhesion of inflammatory cells to the endothelium.

----
[ROLE OF RAGE IN DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
RAGE deficiency has been shown to attenuate the development of atherosclerosis in diabetic mice, with significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque area. This is associated with attenuation of leukocyte recruitment, decreased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, and reduced oxidative stress. However, recent studies suggest that AGEs may not be the major ligand for RAGE, and other pro-inflammatory protein ligands, such as S100 calgranulin family and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), may play a more significant role.

----
[PROTEIN KINASE C ACTIVATION]
Increased protein kinase C (PKC) activation is a key mechanism in the development of microvascular complications in diabetes. Hyperglycemia leads to enhanced de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG), which activates PKC isoforms. This results in tissue injury and is mediated by the interaction between AGEs and their cell-surface receptors. Hyperglycemia primarily activates the β and δ isoforms of PKC, but increases in other isoforms have also been found.

----
[AGE-INDUCED CROSS-LINKS]
AGE-induced cross-links alter tissue function, notably in blood vessels, by decreasing elasticity and increasing fluid filtration. In vitro, AGE formation on intact glomerular basement membrane increases its permeability to albumin, resembling the abnormal permeability of diabetic nephropathy. These changes contribute to the development of microvascular complications in diabetes.
----
[DIABETES MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Microvascular complications in diabetes are mediated by hyperglycemia-induced abnormalities of blood flow and permeability, which can be contributed by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). This activation can lead to the accumulation of microvascular matrix protein and the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production. Hyperglycemia-induced activation of PKC has also been implicated in the overexpression of the fibrinolytic inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1).

----
[PKC ACTIVATION AND DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
The activation of PKC by hyperglycemia has been shown to mediate diabetes-related decreases in retinal and renal blood flow, perhaps by depressing the production of the vasodilator NO and/or increasing endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor. Overactivity of PKC has been implicated in the decreased NO production by the glomerulus in experimental diabetes and by smooth muscle cells in the presence of high glucose levels.

----
[HEXOSAMINE PATHWAY AND DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
Hyperglycemia can cause diabetic complications by shunting glucose into the hexosamine pathway, where fructose-6-phosphate is diverted from glycolysis to provide substrates for reactions that utilize UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This pathway has been implicated in the development of diabetic complications, including microvascular damage.

----
[KEY MOLECULES INVOLVED IN DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
Several key molecules are involved in the development of diabetic complications, including PKC, endothelin-1, NO, TGF-β, VEGF, and PAI-1. These molecules play important roles in regulating blood flow, permeability, and angiogenesis, and their dysregulation can contribute to the development of microvascular complications in diabetes.
----
[GLUCOSAMINE PATHWAY]
The glucosamine pathway is activated by hyperglycemia, resulting in the formation of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, which can modify transcription factors and enhance gene transcription. This pathway has been shown to play a role in hyperglycemia-induced and fat-induced insulin resistance. The rate-limiting step in this pathway is regulated by glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT).

----
[TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR MODIFICATION]
Transcription factors, such as Sp1, can be modified by O-GlcNacylation, which may regulate gene transcription. This modification can compete with phosphorylation to modify the same sites on Sp1, and may be responsible for glucose-responsive gene transcription. Many RNA polymerase II transcription factors are O-GlcNacylated, and this modification may affect their normal function and regulation.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA-INDUCED CHANGES]
Hyperglycemia can increase GFAT activity, leading to increased O-GlcNac modification of proteins, including transcription factors. This can result in changes in gene expression and protein function, contributing to hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance. The inhibition of GFAT can block hyperglycemia-induced increases in gene transcription, highlighting the importance of this pathway in diabetes.

----
[PROTEIN FUNCTION AND REGULATION]
O-GlcNac modification can perturb the normal function and regulation of many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, including eNOS, which is inhibited by O-GlcNacylation. This modification can have significant effects on protein function and may contribute to the development of diabetes-related complications. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which O-GlcNac modification affects protein function and regulation.
----
[MITOCHONDRIAL GLUCOSE OXIDATION]
Intracellular glucose oxidation begins with glycolysis in the cytoplasm, generating NADH and pyruvate. Pyruvate can be transported into the mitochondria where it is oxidized by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce CO2, H2O, and energy-rich molecules. Mitochondrial NADH and FADH2 provide energy for ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation by the electron transport chain. This process is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of diabetic complications.

----
[DIABETIC MICROVASCULAR DAMAGE]
Increased modification of key signaling molecules by O-GlcNAc can cause reduced insulin signal transduction, contributing to diabetic microvascular damage. Pathway selective insulin resistance in vascular cells and resultant overactivation of the MAPK pathway by hyperinsulinemia can also contribute to diabetic microvascular damage. These mechanisms are important to consider in the development of diabetic complications.

----
[MITOCHONDRIAL SUPEROXIDE PRODUCTION]
Mitochondrial superoxide production is a single process underlying different hyperglycemia-induced pathogenic mechanisms. Superoxide is the initial oxygen free radical formed by the mitochondria, which is then converted to other, more reactive species that can damage cells in numerous ways. This process is a key factor in the development of diabetic complications, and understanding its mechanisms is crucial for the development of effective treatments.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA-INDUCED PATHOGENIC MECHANISMS]
Hyperglycemia-induced pathogenic mechanisms, including aldose reductase activity, AGE formation, RAGE ligand binding, PKC activation, and hexosamine pathway flux, can be ameliorated by specific inhibitors. However, these processes are interconnected and have a common cause, which is the overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. Understanding this relationship is important for the development of effective treatments for diabetic complications.
----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA-INDUCED DAMAGE]
Hyperglycemia activates the AGE pathway, leading to the formation of methylglyoxal, which causes increased expression of RAGE and its activating ligands. This results in the activation of the classic PKC pathway and the hexosamine pathway, ultimately leading to hyperglycemic damage. The inhibition of GAPDH increases intracellular levels of glucose, which increases flux through the polyol pathway.

----
[MITOCHONDRIAL SUPEROXIDE PRODUCTION]
Hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial superoxide production inhibits GAPDH activity by modifying the enzyme with polymers of ADP-ribose. This modification and reduction of GAPDH activity can be prevented by inhibiting mitochondrial superoxide production with either UCP-1 or MnSOD, or by a specific inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).

----
[GLYCEMIC MEMORY]
The DCCT study showed that intensive glycemic control can reduce the risk of microvascular complications in people with type 1 diabetes. However, the study also suggested that hyperglycemia can lead to a "glycemic memory" effect, where the body remembers previous episodes of hyperglycemia and responds accordingly, even after glucose levels have returned to normal.

----
[MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION IN DIABETES]
In diabetic cells with high glucose levels, the increased glucose oxidation in the TCA cycle pushes more electron donors into the electron transport chain, increasing the voltage gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. This can lead to the formation of superoxide, a reactive oxygen species that can cause cellular damage. The mitochondrial isoform of the enzyme superoxide dismutase helps to degrade this oxygen free radical, but intracellular hyperglycemia can increase the voltage across the mitochondrial membrane, leading to increased superoxide formation.
----
[DIABETES MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Microvascular complications in diabetes are caused by hyperglycemia-induced cellular damage, which activates several major pathways, including the polyol pathway, hexosamine pathway, protein kinase C pathway, and AGE pathway. The overproduction of superoxide in mitochondria inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), leading to the activation of these pathways. This results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs), which contribute to cellular damage.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive glycemic control dramatically reduces the occurrence and severity of diabetic microvascular complications. Improved glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c, was associated with better outcomes, highlighting the importance of tight blood sugar management in preventing microvascular complications.

----
[LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
The Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) Study, a follow-up to the DCCT, found that the mean HbA1c values for both the intensive therapy and standard therapy groups became statistically identical over approximately 14 years of follow-up. This suggests that the long-term effects of glycemic control on microvascular complications may be sustained even after the initial intensive therapy period.
----
[GLYCEMIC MEMORY]
Glycemic memory refers to the phenomenon where early tight control of blood glucose levels has a lasting impact on the development of diabetic complications, even if glycemic control deteriorates later on. This concept has important clinical implications, including the need for early tight control and the potential for novel therapies to reverse hyperglycemic memory. Hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial superoxide production may contribute to the continuing progression of tissue damage after correction of hyperglycemia. 

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA-INDUCED DAMAGE]
Hyperglycemia can induce long-lasting epigenetic changes in vascular cells, leading to sustained increases in pro-inflammatory gene expression. These changes can persist for at least 6 days of subsequent normal glycemia and may be an HbA1c-independent risk factor for diabetic complications. Hyperglycemia-induced epigenetic changes can be prevented by normalizing mitochondrial superoxide production or superoxide-induced methylglyoxal.

----
[INDIVIDUAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HYPERGLYCEMIA-INDUCED DAMAGE]
The occurrence and progression of diabetic complications vary markedly among patients, and genetic factors may play a role in determining individual susceptibility to hyperglycemia-induced damage. While control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipid profiles are important factors in predicting the risk of complications, they only partially explain the risk for an individual patient. Understanding the genes involved in susceptibility to or protection from complications may provide valuable insights.

----
[CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GLYCEMIC MEMORY]
The concept of glycemic memory has significant clinical implications, including the importance of early tight control of blood glucose levels to prevent or delay the development of diabetic complications. The effects of glycemic memory can persist for many years, even with improvements in glycemic control, and may be relevant to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIABETES NEPHROPATHY RISK]
The risk of developing diabetic nephropathy is significantly higher in siblings with type 1 diabetes if one sibling already has advanced diabetic nephropathy, with reported risks of 83% and 72% in two separate studies.

[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY HISTORY]
The first pathologic reports on diabetic retinopathy (DR) were made by Mackenzie and Nettleship in 1877, who observed capillary aneurysms. The term "diabetic retinopathy" was first coined by Ballantyne and Loewenstein in 1943. The discovery of insulin by Banting and Best in 1921 marked a significant milestone in the treatment of diabetes, and subsequent research has led to a better understanding of the disease and its complications, including diabetic retinopathy.

----
[NORMAL EYE STRUCTURE]
The eye is a complex organ with a specialized photoreceptor cells in the retina, which is the innermost surface of the eye. The central foveal region of the retina is thinner and lacks a direct blood supply, relying on diffusion from the capillaries of the underlying choroid for oxygen and nutrients. The majority of the retina is provided with oxygen by the retinal vascular circulation, and the blood vessels in the retina exhibit tight junctions between adjacent cells, maintaining the blood-retinal barrier.

----
[RISK FACTORS FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
The development of diabetic retinopathy is related to several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, including blood glucose control. Numerous studies have shown that poor glucose control is linked to a greater progression of diabetic retinopathy, and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) confirmed that intensive blood glucose control reduces the risk of new onset diabetic retinopathy and slows the progression of existing diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY CHARACTERISTICS]
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina. It is characterized by the presence of hemorrhages and microaneurysms, which can be seen on the arteriolar side of the circulation. The arterioles are extensively atrophied, indicating damage to the small blood vessels. This damage can lead to vision problems and potentially blindness.

----
[ANATOMY OF THE EYE]
The eye consists of several structures, including the sclera, cornea, pupil, lens, iris, ciliary body, optic nerve, choroid, and retina. Each of these structures plays a crucial role in vision and can be affected by diabetic retinopathy. Understanding the anatomy of the eye is essential for diagnosing and treating diabetic retinopathy. The retina is the innermost layer of the eye and is responsible for converting light into signals that are sent to the brain.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY ANATOMY]
The eye has several major structures, including the inner and outer nuclear cell layers, cones, rods, pigment epithelium, nerve fibre layer, ganglion cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells. The retina consists of multiple layers, with the innermost layer being the inner limiting membrane and the outermost layer being the pigment epithelium. The normal human fovea has a concentration of cones centrally and is surrounded by the inner and outer nuclear cell layers. This anatomy is crucial in understanding diabetic retinopathy.

----
[RETINAL STRUCTURE]
The retinal structure can be visualized through cross-section diagrams and histologic sections, which show the different layers of the retina, including the ganglion cell layer, bipolar layer, and the nuclei of the cones and rods. The pigment epithelium, Bruch's membrane, and choroid vessels are also visible in these sections. Understanding the normal retinal structure is essential in identifying abnormalities associated with diabetic retinopathy.

----
[CAPILLARY STRUCTURE IN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
In diabetic retinopathy, the capillaries are composed of an inner layer of endothelial cells enclosed by a tube of basement membrane, which is surrounded by pericytes. The basement membrane and pericytes play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the capillaries, and damage to these structures can lead to complications associated with diabetic retinopathy. The adherens junctions and tight junctions between the endothelial cells are also important in maintaining the barrier function of the capillaries.
----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY TREATMENT]
Intensive insulin treatment has been shown to have long-term benefits in reducing the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and slowing its progression in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that intensive blood glucose control reduces the risk of new onset DR and slows the progression of existing DR in patients with type 2 diabetes. Controlling systemic hypertension and reducing elevated lipid levels also have a positive impact on reducing the risk and progression of DR.
----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY RISK FACTORS]
Elevated serum lipids are associated with macular exudates and moderate visual loss, while smoking may be a risk factor in the progression of DR in type 1 diabetes. Non-modifiable risk factors for DR include duration of diabetes, age, and genetic predisposition, with some studies suggesting a link between human leukocyte antigens and the severity of DR.
----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY AND ETHNICITY]
There is evidence to suggest that certain ethnic groups, such as Latin Americans and African-Americans, have a higher prevalence of diabetic retinopathy compared to whites of Northern European ancestry. Similarly, studies have shown that moderate or more severe DR is more common in Polynesians than Europeans, with these differences not being fully explained by traditional risk factors such as age, duration of diagnosed diabetes, and blood pressure.
----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
The early histopathologic signs of diabetic retinopathy include thickening of the basement membrane and pericyte loss, which is an early and crucial event in the development of DR. Pericytes are sensitive to high glucose concentrations and undergo apoptosis, leading to the progression of DR.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY CHARACTERISTICS]
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterized by increased blood flow and impaired autoregulation, leading to persistent dilatation of retinal arterioles and widespread areas of retinal ischemia. As DR progresses, capillary occlusion and intravascular coagulation occur, which can be enhanced by increased platelet stickiness. This can result in the formation of acellular capillaries and breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT]
A comprehensive assessment of DR includes a carefully taken history and high-quality clinical examination, including visual acuity, color vision, and inspection of external structures. Eye examination techniques such as direct ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy are used to diagnose and monitor retinal disease. Pupils are typically dilated with 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine to facilitate examination.

----
[MULTIDISCIPLINARY MANAGEMENT]
Effective management of DR requires a multidisciplinary approach, with good communication between ophthalmologists, diabetic physicians, and general practitioners. It is essential to control risk factors and be aware of the patient's overall management plan. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the patient's medical history, including diabetes control, to provide comprehensive care.

----
[INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES]
Investigative techniques such as digital color retinal photography and fundus fluorescein angiography are used to assess and monitor DR. These techniques help to detect retinal lesions, microaneurysms, and other abnormalities, allowing for early diagnosis and treatment. Retinal photography provides a record of retinal lesions, while fluorescein angiography helps to visualize the retinal vasculature and detect areas of leakage or ischemia.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
The pathophysiology of DR involves the breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier, leading to increased capillary permeability and leakage of plasma proteins. Microaneurysms, which are characteristic of retinal microvascular disease in diabetes, may be caused by asymmetric dilatations of the capillary wall due to loss of supporting pericytes and localized increases in hydrostatic pressure. Smooth muscle cell death and capillary weakening also contribute to the development of DR.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING]
Screening for diabetic retinopathy is the presumptive identification of unrecognized disease or defect by applying tests, examinations, or procedures that can be applied rapidly. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines screening as a method to sort out apparently well persons who probably have a disease from those who probably do not. A screening test is not intended to be diagnostic. The goal of screening is to identify individuals with potential diabetic retinopathy early, allowing for prompt treatment and prevention of complications.

----
[PERIMETRY IN DIABETES CARE]
Perimetry is the systematic measurement of differential light sensitivity in the visual field, used to map and quantify the visual field in individuals with diabetes. This test is typically performed on each eye independently, but can also be done binocularly for driving field assessment. Perimetry is an important tool in detecting and monitoring diabetic retinopathy and other microvascular complications.

----
[IMAGING TECHNIQUES FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Several imaging techniques are used to diagnose and monitor diabetic retinopathy, including fundus fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and ultrasound B scan examination. These techniques provide detailed images of the retina and can help detect signs of retinopathy, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and retinal detachment. OCT, in particular, uses interferometry to interpret reflected optical waves and can present images as cross-sectional or topographic maps.

----
[FUNDUS FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAPHY]
Fundus fluorescein angiography is an imaging technique that uses a fluorescent dye to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. The dye causes the blood vessels to fluoresce, allowing for detailed images of the retinal vasculature to be taken. While generally safe, the dye can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and skin rashes, and more serious reactions like anaphylactic shock are rare.
----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY COSTS AND TREATMENT]
The costs of screening and effective treatment of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR) are balanced economically in relation to total expenditure on healthcare, considering the consequences of leaving the disease untreated. Effective treatment, including laser treatment, can prevent the progression of DR and reduce the risk of vision loss. Early detection and treatment are crucial in managing the disease. 

----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY LESIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS]
Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by specific lesions, including microaneurysms and retinal hemorrhages, which are critical to the stages of progression of the disease. Microaneurysms are defined as small, red spots with sharp margins, while retinal hemorrhages are characterized by irregular margins and uneven density. These lesions can be detected through screening and are essential in diagnosing and monitoring DR.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF SCREENING FOR DIABETES RETINOPATHY]
Sight-threatening DR is a significant public health problem, and its incidence is expected to increase worldwide due to the rising prevalence of diabetes. However, DR has a recognizable latent stage, and laser treatment is effective in preventing vision loss. Intensive control of blood glucose and systemic hypertension can also reduce the risk of new onset DR and slow its progression.

----
[SCREENING TESTS FOR DIABETES RETINOPATHY]
A suitable and reliable screening test for sight-threatening DR is available, using digital photography, which is acceptable to both healthcare professionals and the public. This screening test can detect early signs of DR, allowing for prompt referral to physicians for diagnosis and necessary treatment, and preventing the progression of the disease.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SIGNS]
Diabetic retinopathy can be identified by various signs, including hemorrhages, microaneurysms, hard exudates, and cotton wool spots. These signs can be detected through fluorescein angiograms and other imaging techniques. Hemorrhages and microaneurysms are often difficult to differentiate, leading to the concept of Hemorrhage/microaneurysm (HMa). This concept represents a small hemorrhage or microaneurysm.

----
[HEMORRHAGE TYPES]
There are different types of hemorrhages that can occur in diabetic retinopathy, including flame hemorrhages and blot hemorrhages. Flame hemorrhages are superficial hemorrhages that occur just under the nerve fiber layer, while blot hemorrhages are deeper hemorrhages that signify retinal ischemia. These hemorrhages can be identified through imaging techniques, such as fluorescein angiograms.

----
[HARD EXUDATES]
Hard exudates are small white or yellowish-white deposits with sharp margins that are typically located in the outer layers of the retina. They can also be more superficial, particularly when retinal edema is present. Hard exudates are an important sign of diabetic retinopathy and can be detected through imaging techniques.

----
[COTTON WOOL SPOTS]
Cotton wool spots are fluffy white opaque areas caused by an accumulation of axoplasm in the nerve fiber layer of the retina. They are often a sign of arteriolar occlusion in a particular area of the retina and can be detected through fluorescein angiograms. Cotton wool spots are an important indicator of diabetic retinopathy and can help diagnose the condition.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY CHARACTERISTICS]
Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by various abnormalities, including new vessels on and/or within 1 disc diameter of the disc, new vessels elsewhere, vitreous hemorrhage, and preretinal hemorrhages. These abnormalities can be seen in figures 36.16, 36.17, and 36.18. Vitreous hemorrhage is a hemorrhage that occurs in the vitreous gel, while preretinal hemorrhages are boat-shaped hemorrhages that occur just anterior to the retina.

----
[INTRARETINAL MICROVASCULAR ABNORMALITIES]
Intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) are defined as tortuous intraretinal vascular segments that vary in caliber, resulting from remodeling of the retinal capillaries and small collateral vessels in areas of microvascular occlusion. IRMA is a sign of retinal ischemia and can be seen in Figure 36.13. These abnormalities are associated with retinal ischemia and are an important aspect of diabetic retinopathy.

----
[VENOUS ABNORMALITIES IN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Venous abnormalities in diabetic retinopathy include venous loops, venous beading, venous dilatation, venous narrowing, opacification of the venous wall, and perivenous exudate. Venous beading is a localized increase in caliber of the vein and is associated with retinal ischemia, as seen in Figure 36.15. These abnormalities are important to identify in the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy.

----
[ARTERIOLAR ABNORMALITIES IN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Arteriolar abnormalities in diabetic retinopathy include arteriolar narrowing, opacification of arteriolar walls, and arteriovenous nipping. These changes can occur in addition to other retinal abnormalities and are important to consider in the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy.

----
[FIBROUS PROLIFERATION IN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Fibrous proliferation at the disc (FPD) and fibrous proliferation elsewhere (FPE) can occur in diabetic retinopathy, usually when new vessels start to regress and fibrosis occurs. These changes can be an important aspect of the disease and its progression, and are relevant to the management of diabetic retinopathy.
----
[DIABETIC MACULOPATHY CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetic maculopathy can be classified into three main types: focal, diffuse, and ischemic. Focal maculopathy is further subdivided into focal exudates and focal/multifocal edema. The classification of diabetic maculopathy is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment approach. 
----
[MACULOPATHY PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
The pathophysiology of macular edema in diabetes involves the breakdown of the blood-retina barrier, leading to extracellular fluid accumulation. In focal macular edema, leakage occurs from microaneurysms, while in diffuse macular edema, there is a generalized breakdown of the blood-retina barrier. Ischemic maculopathy is characterized by capillary closure and enlargement of the foveal avascular zone.
----
[LASER TREATMENT FOR DIABETIC MACULOPATHY]
Laser treatment, specifically focal (direct/grid) laser photocoagulation, has been shown to reduce moderate vision loss caused by diabetic maculopathy. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) demonstrated the effectiveness of this treatment approach in 1985. Post-laser treatment, photocoagulation laser scars may be visible, and surgical intervention may be required in severe cases of macular traction.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR DIABETIC MACULOPATHY]
Fluorescein angiography is a diagnostic tool used to visualize the leakage in diabetic maculopathy, with most leakage occurring in the venous phase of the angiogram. Optical coherence tomography is also used to diagnose and monitor diabetic maculopathy, providing detailed images of the retina and its abnormalities.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY CLASSIFICATION]
The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) classifies diabetic retinopathy into several stages, including no apparent retinopathy, mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), moderate NPDR, moderately severe NPDR, severe NPDR, mild proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), moderate PDR, high-risk PDR, and advanced PDR. Each stage is characterized by specific lesions and has a corresponding risk of progression to PDR within 1 year. The ETDRS classification is based on 7 × 30° field stereo photographs of each eye.

----
[RETINOPATHY PROGRESSION RISK]
The risk of progression to PDR within 1 year varies by stage, ranging from 6.2% for level 30 (mild NPDR) to 54.8% for level 55 (severe NPDR). The risk of progression is higher for more advanced stages of retinopathy. Regular follow-up intervals are recommended, ranging from 1 year for mild NPDR to 3 months for severe NPDR.

----
[MACULOPATHY CLASSIFICATION]
The ETDRS also classifies maculopathy, with clinically significant macular edema defined as retinal thickening or hard exudates within 1 disc diameter of the center of the macula. Laser treatment may be considered for these cases. Simplified classifications, such as the International Classification and the English Screening Classification, have been developed to facilitate clinical application.

----
[TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS]
The Diabetic Retinopathy Study recommends treating eyes with high-risk characteristics, such as new vessels on or within 1 disc diameter of the optic disc, with photocoagulation to reduce the risk of severe visual loss. Treatment recommendations vary by stage of retinopathy and presence of maculopathy. Regular follow-up and timely treatment are essential to prevent vision loss in patients with diabetic retinopathy.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetic retinopathy is classified into different stages, including microaneurysms only, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The International Clinical Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy severity includes five stages: R0 (no DR), R1 (background DR), R2 (preproliferative DR), R3 (proliferative DR). Each stage has distinct characteristics, such as the presence of microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhages, and neovascularization.

----
[SCREENING AND REFERRAL GUIDELINES]
Patients with diabetic retinopathy should be screened annually, with referral to an ophthalmologist recommended for those with more severe disease, such as preproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The recommended outcome for patients with microaneurysms only is to optimize medical therapy and screen at least annually. Patients with severe NPDR or PDR may require prompt treatment, including scatter photocoagulation or urgent referral to an ophthalmologist.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Treatment options for diabetic retinopathy include scatter photocoagulation, which is recommended for patients with severe NPDR or PDR, particularly those with vitreous hemorrhage or neovascularization. Panretinal photocoagulation is also used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, with the goal of reducing the risk of vision loss. Laser treatment scars can be seen in the retina after photocoagulation, as shown in Figure 36.19.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DETECTION AND REFERRAL]
Early detection and referral to an ophthalmologist are crucial for patients with diabetic retinopathy, as prompt treatment can help prevent vision loss and reduce the risk of complications. Patients with diabetic retinopathy should be aware of the importance of regular screening and follow-up appointments to monitor the progression of their disease and receive timely treatment.
----
[DIABETIC MACULOPATHY CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetic macular edema is classified into three stages: mild, moderate, and severe, based on the presence and extent of retinal thickening or hard exudates in the posterior pole. The classification is crucial for determining the appropriate referral and treatment. The international and English classification systems provide a framework for diagnosing and managing diabetic maculopathy.

----
[MACULOPATHY STAGES]
The stages of diabetic maculopathy are defined as follows: mild (some retinal thickening or hard exudates distant from the macula), moderate (retinal thickening or hard exudates approaching the center of the macula), and severe (retinal thickening or hard exudates involving the center of the macula). Each stage has specific criteria for referral and treatment.

----
[RETINAL THICKENING CRITERIA]
Retinal thickening is a key criterion for diagnosing diabetic maculopathy, and its presence and extent determine the stage of the disease. The criteria for retinal thickening include the presence of microaneurysms or hemorrhages within 1 disc diameter of the center of the fovea, and retinal thickening within 1 disc diameter of the center of the fovea if stereo is available.

----
[VISUAL ACUITY AND REFERRAL]
Visual acuity is an important factor in determining the need for referral and treatment in diabetic maculopathy. A best visual acuity of ≤ 6/12 is a criterion for referral, particularly if associated with microaneurysms or hemorrhages within 1 disc diameter of the center of the fovea. Referral is also recommended for patients with retinal thickening or hard exudates approaching or involving the center of the macula.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY IMAGING]
Diabetic retinopathy can be diagnosed and monitored using various imaging techniques, including fluorescein angiogram, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and topographic mapping. These images can show signs of macular edema, such as leakage and fluid accumulation. Figure 36.21 illustrates the use of these imaging modalities to diagnose and assess macular edema. 

----
[MACULAR EDEMA DIAGNOSIS]
Macular edema is a significant complication of diabetic retinopathy, characterized by fluid accumulation in the macula. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images can help diagnose and assess the severity of macular edema, as shown in Figure 36.21. Topographic maps can also be used to visualize the extent of edema.

----
[MACULAR TRACTION]
Macular traction can occur as a result of fibrotic proliferations following panretinal photocoagulation, a treatment for diabetic retinopathy. This can lead to further complications, such as vision loss. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images can help diagnose macular traction, as illustrated in Figure 36.22.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY TREATMENT]
Diabetic retinopathy treatment may involve macular laser treatment, which can have potential side effects such as a drop in visual acuity or the development of choroidal neovascular membrane. Laser treatment can cause laser burns, which may be associated with paracentral scotomas and can become larger than the original spot size. Intravitreal triamcinolone has shown promising results in improving vision in eyes with chronic diabetic macular edema unresponsive to conventional laser treatment.

----
[MACULAR EDEMA PARAMETERS]
Clinically significant macular edema is defined by specific parameters, including thickening of the retina at or within 500 μm of the center of the macula, hard exudates at or within 500 μm of the center of the fovea, or a zone of retinal thickening 1 disc area or larger within 1 disc diameter of the center of the macula. These parameters are used to determine the need for treatment. Treatment can reduce macular thickness and induce diabetic maculopathy edema by 50% or more.

----
[MECHANISMS OF LASER TREATMENT]
The effectiveness of focal laser treatment for macular edema may be caused by the closure of leaky microaneurysms, as well as histopathologic changes and biochemical mechanisms. Laser treatment can cause changes in the retina, including blanching and clearing of exudates, which can improve vision in patients with diabetic macular edema. The exact mechanisms of laser treatment are not fully understood, but it is thought to involve multiple factors.
----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY CLASSIFICATION]
The International classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR) recommends that anyone with a more severe disorder than microaneurysms be referred to an ophthalmologist. In the UK, patients with background DR are rescreened annually. Background DR is defined by the presence of microaneurysms and retinal hemorrhages with or without exudate.

----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY PROGRESSION]
For mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), there is a 6.2% risk of progression to proliferative retinopathy within 1 year. The risk of progression to proliferative retinopathy varies depending on the presence of microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhages, and other lesions. Patients with no DR and microaneurysms only have a lower risk of progression.

----
[DIABETES RETINOPATHY LESIONS]
Lesions associated with increasing retinal ischemia in moderate and severe NPDR include retinal hemorrhages, especially blot hemorrhages, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. These lesions are derived from remodeling of the retinal capillaries and small collateral vessels. Cotton wool spots may also be present, but are not a good sign of increasing retinal ischemia.

----
[TREATMENT OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors are used to treat diabetic retinopathy. However, serious side effects such as early rapid increases in intraocular pressure and infectious endophthalmitis have been reported. Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of these treatments.

----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING]
The earliest sign of mild non-proliferative DR or background DR is microaneurysms. Patients with microaneurysms or one hemorrhage in one eye only have a higher risk of progression to proliferative retinopathy. Regular screening is essential to detect and manage diabetic retinopathy early.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY PATHOGENESIS]
Diabetic retinopathy involves the formation of new vessels in the retina, which can lead to vision loss. New vessels arise from the post-capillary venule in areas of ischemic retina, either within 1 disc diameter of the optic disc or from retinal vessels more than 1 disc diameter away. The growth factors that contribute to retinal neovascularization include fibroblast-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor I, platelet-derived growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and VEGF.

----
[RETINAL NEOVASCULARIZATION CHARACTERISTICS]
The characteristic appearance of new vessels on a fluorescein angiogram is leakage appearing in the arteriovenous phase, which increases throughout the angiogram. New vessels can penetrate the internal limiting membrane, leading to leakage and potential vision loss. Patients with diabetic retinopathy may present asymptomatically or with visual loss due to hemorrhage from new vessels.

----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY CLASSIFICATION]
The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) has defined a classification system for diabetic retinopathy, including the "4:2:1 rule" for severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). This rule indicates severe NPDR if there are severe hemorrhages in four quadrants, venous beading in two quadrants, or intraretinal microvascular abnormality in one quadrant. The International classification and English Screening classification also provide guidelines for defining the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY TREATMENT]
Laser treatment is a common approach for managing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The treatment aims to reduce the risk of vision loss by targeting areas of microvascular occlusion and preventing further neovascularization. Figures 36.26 and 36.27 illustrate the appearance of new vessels on fluorescein angiogram and the laser treatment approach for PDR, respectively.
----
[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF LASER TREATMENT]
Adverse effects of panretinal laser treatment include unintended laser absorption, inadvertent coagulation, and choroidal detachment. Unintended laser absorption can result in a burn and destruction of the nerve fiber layer, while inadvertent coagulation can occur in areas such as the fovea. Choroidal detachment is usually a result of a large dose of laser treatment being applied in a single session, but typically resolves spontaneously within 10 days.

----
[RISKS TO OPHTHALMOLOGISTS AND OBSERVERS]
There is a risk of excessive exposure to reflected light, particularly blue light, for ophthalmologists performing laser treatment, but modern technology with appropriate filters has significantly reduced this risk. The risk to observers is extremely small, but as a precaution, it is advised that they wear appropriate spectacle protection.

----
[FACTORS INFLUENCING LASER TREATMENT DECISIONS]
The decision to perform laser treatment is influenced by factors such as anterior segment neovascularization, signs of ischemia, and high-risk characteristics. Extensive neovascularization in the anterior chamber angle is an urgent indication for scatter laser photocoagulation, while signs of ischemia, such as large IRMA and retinal hemorrhages, also suggest the need for prompt treatment.

----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY STUDY FINDINGS]
The Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) recommended prompt treatment in the presence of high-risk characteristics, which reduced the 2-year risk of severe visual loss by 50% or more. The study defined high-risk characteristics as the presence of preretinal or vitreous hemorrhage, eyes with NVD equalling or exceeding one-quarter to one-third disc area, and NVE equalling more than half disc area with hemorrhage.

----
[RISKS OF SEVERE VISUAL LOSS]
Untreated eyes with high-risk characteristics have a 25.6-36.9% chance of severe visual loss within 2 years, depending on the size and location of new vessels and the presence of hemorrhage. Even in eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) without high-risk characteristics, there is still a risk of severe visual loss, with untreated eyes having a 2-year risk of 7.0% and a 4-year risk of 20.9%.

----
[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF LASER TREATMENT IN STUDIES]
Studies such as the DRS have reported adverse effects of laser treatment, including loss of peripheral areas of visual field and visual acuity loss. The DRS found that approximately 10% of eyes treated with argon laser experienced loss of peripheral visual field, while 14.3% of eyes with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) experienced early persistent loss of one or more lines of visual acuity.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY TREATMENT]
Diabetic retinopathy treatment may involve laser photocoagulation, which can be used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy and concurrent maculopathy. The treatment approach may vary depending on the individual case, and factors such as past history of retinopathy and renal failure need to be considered. Controlling hypertension is also important, especially in patients with renal failure.

----
[LASER PHOTOCOAGULATION TECHNIQUES]
Laser photocoagulation techniques have evolved, with a trend towards reducing the duration of the burn and increasing the power to produce a similar effect. Pattern scan laser technology allows for automated multiple spots to be produced with each depression of the foot pedal, reducing the laser pulse time from 100 ms to 10-20 ms. This approach requires higher power for shorter burns.

----
[PROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY WITH MACULOPATHY]
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy with maculopathy (Stage R3 with M1) requires a tailored treatment approach. The ETDRS study recommends treating clinically significant macular edema with focal/grid photocoagulation before beginning scatter laser treatment. However, in cases where the risk of vitreous hemorrhage or neovascular glaucoma is high, a combined treatment approach may be necessary.

----
[USE OF INTRAVITREAL VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR INHIBITORS]
Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, such as pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab, have been used to treat ocular neovascularization and increased vascular permeability associated with diabetic retinopathy. These agents have shown promise in reducing macular thickness and neovascularization, but their effects are often transient, requiring repeated injections to sustain any beneficial effects.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetic retinopathy can lead to various complications, including vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage associated with tractional retinal detachment. These complications can occur in patients with diabetes, with vitreous hemorrhage being the most common, affecting 86.1% of patients. Vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. 

----
[MACULAR EDEMA TREATMENT]
For clinically significant macular edema, optical coherence tomography (OCT) should be performed to test for posterior hyaloid thickening, and vitrectomy should be considered when a shallow macular detachment is found. Studies have shown that vitrectomy can be effective in increasing the quality of life of patients with diabetic retinopathy. 

----
[RISK FACTORS FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY PROGRESSION IN PREGNANCY]
The known risk factors for progression of diabetic retinopathy in pregnancy are not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it is mentioned that pregnancy can impact the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Further research is needed to understand the risk factors and develop effective treatment regimens. 

----
[INTRAVITREAL INJECTION TREATMENT]
Intravitreal injection is an effective means of delivering anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs to the retina, but it has potential complications such as endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. Randomized controlled trials are required to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of this treatment. 

----
[VITRECTOMY FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that can be used to treat diabetic retinopathy, particularly for complications such as vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment. According to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), at least 5% of eyes receiving optimal medical treatment will still have progressive retinopathy that requires laser treatment and pars plana vitrectomy.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY RISK FACTORS]
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can lead to vision loss, and its progression is influenced by various factors, including age at diagnosis, blood pressure control, and serum lipid levels. Studies have shown that intensive blood glucose control can reduce the risk of complications, including diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, factors such as cigarette smoking and pregnancy can also impact the progression of diabetic retinopathy.

----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY PROGRESSION]
The progression of diabetic retinopathy is also influenced by the baseline severity of the disease and poor metabolic control. Research has identified that patients with type 1 diabetes who have had the disease for a shorter duration are at a higher risk of microangiopathy. Furthermore, studies have shown that reducing elevated serum lipid levels can lead to regression of retinal hard exudates in diabetic retinopathy.

----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY AND PREGNANCY]
Pregnancy itself is independently associated with the progression of diabetic retinopathy, highlighting the need for close monitoring and management of diabetes during pregnancy. This is particularly important, as diabetic retinopathy can have significant implications for vision and overall health. Regular eye exams and tight blood glucose control are essential for preventing or delaying the onset of diabetic retinopathy in pregnant women with diabetes.

[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING]
Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes that can lead to visual impairment and blindness. Regular screening is essential to detect and treat the condition early. Digital imaging photography and technician ophthalmoscopy have been shown to be effective methods for screening for diabetic retinopathy. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends single-field fundus photography for diabetic retinopathy screening.

----
[PHOTOCOAGULATION TREATMENT]
Photocoagulation is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy that involves the use of laser therapy to reduce the risk of visual loss. Studies have shown that photocoagulation can be effective in treating diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) has reported on the long-term effects of laser photocoagulation treatment in patients with diabetic retinopathy.

----
[COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SCREENING AND TREATMENT]
The cost-effectiveness of screening and treating diabetic retinopathy has been evaluated in several studies. These studies have shown that screening and treatment can be cost-effective, particularly when it prevents visual loss and reduces the need for more costly interventions. The cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies, including digital imaging photography and technician ophthalmoscopy, has also been compared.

----
[CLASSIFICATION AND GRADING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
The classification and grading of diabetic retinopathy are important for determining the severity of the condition and guiding treatment. The modified Airlie House classification is a widely used system for grading diabetic retinopathy from stereoscopic color fundus photographs. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group has reported on an extension of this classification system.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY RESEARCH]
Research on diabetic retinopathy has led to the identification of various genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in the disease, including the role of basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor. Studies have also investigated the use of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (Avastin) and pegaptanib (Macugen) as treatments for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These findings have contributed to the development of new therapeutic approaches for managing diabetic retinopathy.

----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY TREATMENT]
Treatment options for diabetic retinopathy include photocoagulation, vitrectomy, and intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. The Diabetic Retinopathy Study and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study have provided guidelines for the indications and techniques for photocoagulation treatment. Vitrectomy has also been shown to be effective in managing complications of diabetic retinopathy, such as vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment.

----
[INTRAVITREAL INJECTIONS FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (Avastin) have been shown to be effective in reducing neovascularization and improving visual acuity in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Other anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, such as pegaptanib (Macugen), have also been investigated as potential treatments for diabetic retinopathy. These intravitreal injections have become an important part of the treatment arsenal for managing diabetic retinopathy.

----
[VITRECTOMY FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY]
Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the vitreous gel from the eye and has been shown to be effective in managing complications of diabetic retinopathy, such as vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Studies have demonstrated that vitrectomy can improve visual acuity and reduce the risk of further complications in patients with diabetic retinopathy. However, vitrectomy is typically reserved for more advanced cases of diabetic retinopathy.
----
[DIABETIC RETINOPATHY IN PREGNANCY]
Diabetic retinopathy can progress during pregnancy, and tight metabolic control is crucial to minimize its impact. Studies have shown that pregnancy can accelerate the progression of diabetic retinopathy in women with type 1 diabetes. The effect of pregnancy on diabetic retinopathy is a significant concern, and regular monitoring is essential to prevent vision loss.

----
[CAUSES OF BLINDNESS AND PARTIAL SIGHT]
Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness and partial sight in England and Wales. According to various studies, diabetes is a significant contributor to blindness and visual impairment, highlighting the importance of proper management and care to prevent these complications.

----
[IMPACT OF PREGNANCY ON DIABETIC RETINOPATHY PROGRESSION]
Pregnancy can impact the progression of diabetic retinopathy, and factors such as hypertension during pregnancy can contribute to its acceleration. Studies have investigated the relationship between pregnancy and diabetic retinopathy progression, emphasizing the need for close monitoring and management during this period.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF METABOLIC CONTROL]
Metabolic control is critical in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy, especially during pregnancy. Research has shown that regulating hyperglycemia can help minimize the changes in diabetic retinopathy during pregnancy, highlighting the importance of tight blood sugar control.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY CHARACTERISTICS]
Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by gradually increasing urine albumin excretion (UAE) over many years, accompanied by slowly rising blood pressure (BP), with a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) occurring late. Individuals with nephropathy are at greatly increased risk of other microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. The risk of cardiovascular disease increases as UAE increases and as GFR decreases.

----
[PREVALENCE AND PROGRESSION OF NEPHROPATHY]
Approximately 30-50% of Caucasian people with diabetes will develop microalbuminuria, with a higher prevalence in non-Caucasians. One-third of people with diabetes will progress to proteinuria and be at high risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Factors most closely associated with progression of nephropathy are poor glucose and BP control, and baseline UAE.

----
[SCREENING AND PREVENTION OF NEPHROPATHY]
Screening for diabetic nephropathy should be performed annually, by measuring urine albumin: creatinine ratio and estimated GFR (eGFR). Good blood glucose and BP control are key to prevention of nephropathy. If UAE is raised, an inhibitor of the renin angiotensin system should be commenced and titrated up to the maximum tolerated dose.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF NEPHROPATHY]
Maintaining BP < 125/75 mmHg will reduce the rate of decline of GFR from 10-12 to 3-5 mL/min/1.73 m2. Reducing dietary protein intake to 0.7-1.0 g/kg body weight per day may slow the deterioration in renal function. Aggressive management of other cardiovascular risk factors and prescription of aspirin reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events and of progression to nephropathy by around 60%.

----
[END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE (ESRD) MANAGEMENT]
Renal failure from diabetes is the most common single cause of entry to renal replacement programs worldwide, with the majority of patients having type 2 diabetes plus major co-morbidities. Patients with ESRD and significant co-morbidities should be offered dialysis, while fitter patients benefit from kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation, but need full cardiovascular assessment and treatment before transplantation if necessary.
----
[DIABETES-RELATED KIDNEY DAMAGE]
In individuals with Type 1 diabetes, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may be increased above normal during the acute presentation of the disease. However, with insulin therapy, UAE returns to normal in most individuals, while GFR returns to normal in the majority but remains above normal in 25-40%. This has implications for the risk of progression to diabetic nephropathy. 
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY PROGRESSION]
In patients who will develop diabetic nephropathy, UAE increases gradually, with microalbuminuria usually appearing within 5-15 years of diabetes. Untreated, the mean increase in UAE is 20% per year, and approximately 1.5-2.5% per year develop microalbuminuria. One-third of patients with Type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria will progress to proteinuria, one-third will remain microalbuminuric, and one-third will revert to normal UAE.
----
[DEFINITIONS OF KIDNEY DAMAGE]
Normal urinary albumin excretion (UAE), microalbuminuria, and proteinuria are defined by specific albumin: creatinine ratios, timed overnight urine albumin excretion rates, and 24-hour urine collection amounts. These definitions are used to stage chronic kidney disease based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin excretion (UAE).
----
[STAGING OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE]
Chronic kidney disease is staged based on eGFR and UAE, with five stages ranging from normal kidney function to established renal failure. Each stage has specific criteria for eGFR and UAE, and other evidence of kidney disease, such as microalbuminuria or persistent proteinuria, may also be considered.
----
[DIABETES NEPHROPATHY INCIDENCE]
The incidence of diabetic nephropathy may be declining in some centers, although it is unclear whether this represents true prevention or delay in progression. The natural history of nephropathy in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is similar to that of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), with some notable exceptions. At diagnosis, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) may be raised but generally returns to normal with good glycemic control. However, in 10-48% of cases, microalbuminuria persists.

----
[DIABETES NEPHROPATHY PROGRESSION]
Longitudinal studies have shown that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is generally increased in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance who later progress to frank diabetes. After diagnosis, GFR remains stable with the onset of microalbuminuria, only beginning to decline when proteinuria develops. The rate of progression from normal UAE to microalbuminuria is 3-4% per annum, which is at least as high as, if not higher than, in T1DM.

----
[DIABETES NEPHROPATHY PREVALENCE]
The prevalence of microalbuminuria in established diabetes varies between 10-42%, depending on population selection, with higher prevalences reported in certain ethnic groups such as UK Asians, Pima Indians, African-Americans, and Maori and Pacific Islanders. Approximately 7% of microalbuminuric patients with T2DM develop proteinuria per year, and after 20 years' duration of T2DM, the cumulative incidence of proteinuria is around 27%.

----
[DIABETES NEPHROPATHY OUTCOMES]
Once proteinuria develops, the untreated rate of decline of GFR is similar to that in T1DM, although it may be greater in non-Europid subjects. Rates for acceptance onto renal replacement therapy (RRT) are higher in African-Caribbean and Indo-Asian than Europid people with diabetes. In some populations, such as the Pima Indians, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has declined since 1990, suggesting slowing of progression.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY RISK FACTORS]
The degree of albuminuria is an independent predictor of nephropathy, with higher levels increasing the risk of developing microalbuminuria and proteinuria. Baseline albuminuria is the strongest predictor of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Additionally, genetic susceptibility, conventional cardiovascular risk factors, and inflammatory markers also contribute to the risk of developing nephropathy. 

----
[GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEPHROPATHY]
There is evidence of a genetic susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Type 1 diabetes, with only 40% of patients being at risk. If one sibling with diabetes has nephropathy, the risk to a second sibling is increased four- to eightfold. The genetic susceptibility to nephropathy may also influence the development of cardiovascular disease.

----
[OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR NEPHROPATHY]
Other possible risk factors for nephropathy include pre-eclampsia, inflammatory markers, cytokines, growth factors, periodontitis, and high levels of mannose-binding lectin (MBL). Patients with Type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are also more likely to have chronic kidney disease (CKD).

----
[ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetic nephropathy is associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other microvascular complications. The risk of CVD is greatly increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy, with a 10-fold increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.

----
[CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK]
In Type 1 diabetes, the relative risk of CVD is 1.2-fold in microalbuminuric and 10-fold higher in proteinuric patients. In Type 2 diabetes, the risk of CVD is increased two- to fourfold with microalbuminuria and ninefold with proteinuria. The risk of CVD increases exponentially once serum creatinine is outside the normal range.

----
[NON-CLASSIC DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY]
One-third of patients with Type 2 diabetes with raised urinary albumin excretion (UAE) do not have classic histologic changes of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Some patients with Type 2 diabetes with a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) have normal albumin excretion or only low levels of microalbuminuria, highlighting the existence of non-classic diabetic nephropathy.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY CHARACTERISTICS]
Diabetic nephropathy is often associated with significant retinopathy, particularly in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and microalbuminuria or more severe renal disease. In patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the relationship between nephropathy and retinopathy is less clear-cut. Peripheral neuropathy is also more common in patients with diabetes and renal disease, associating with both albuminuria and declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
----
[SCREENING FOR KIDNEY DISEASE IN DIABETES]
Early identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes allows for intensification of therapy to slow the progression of kidney disease and manage the increased risk of other complications. Systematic screening, including measurements of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and GFR, is recommended as part of the annual review. Screening should be undertaken when the person is free of acute illness and in stable glucose control.
----
[HYPERTENSION IN DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY]
Hypertension is an invariable accompaniment of persistent proteinuria and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetic nephropathy. The excess prevalence of hypertension in T1DM is confined to patients with nephropathy, suggesting that hypertension is an integral part of diabetic nephropathy. Patients with UAE in the high normal range, who are at increased risk of progression to microalbuminuria, have a higher blood pressure (BP) than those with lower UAE.
----
[CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY]
The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases as GFR decreases in both T1DM and T2DM. UAE and declining GFR may have independent effects on CVD risk. Patients with nephropathy are also more likely to have other microvascular complications, and the absence of other microvascular complications should prompt questioning of the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.
----
[DIAGNOSING KIDNEY DISEASE IN DIABETES]
Diagnosing kidney disease in diabetes requires excluding other treatable causes of kidney disease. If the diagnosis is unclear, referral to a nephrologist is appropriate, and tests such as ultrasound of the renal tract and measurement of autoantibodies and immunoglobulins may be helpful. The albumin:creatinine ratio should be measured every 3 months to identify true changes in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) over time. 
----
[MONITORING KIDNEY DISEASE PROGRESSION]
Monitoring kidney disease progression involves measuring the albumin:creatinine ratio every 3 months, as well as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) every 3-6 months. This provides sufficient information to identify changes in UAE and assess the rate of decline of GFR in response to therapy. The eGFR can be used to estimate when an individual will reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
----
[PREVENTING KIDNEY DISEASE IN DIABETES]
Preventing kidney disease in diabetes is crucial, and good blood glucose control can greatly reduce the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. In type 2 diabetes, blood pressure control is also important. While much can be done to slow progression when UAE is raised or GFR has begun to decline, it may not be possible to avoid ESRD. 
----
[SCREENING FOR KIDNEY DISEASE]
Screening for kidney disease in diabetes involves collecting early morning urine samples and measuring the albumin:creatinine ratio. At least two out of three measurements should be abnormal before a diagnosis of microalbuminuria or proteinuria is made. Serum creatinine should also be measured annually, and eGFR should be calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. 
----
[ALTERNATIVE MARKERS FOR KIDNEY DISEASE]
Serum cystatin C has been suggested as an alternative to creatinine for estimating GFR, but its ability to detect changes in GFR before serum creatinine has risen is uncertain. Therefore, it is premature to use cystatin C as a marker of GFR, and serum creatinine remains the preferred method for estimating GFR.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS PREVENTION]
Prevention of diabetic nephropathy can be achieved through glucose control and blood pressure control. In type 2 diabetes, intensive glucose control has been shown to reduce the risk of microalbuminuria and proteinuria by approximately 30% after 9-12 years. The UKPDS study found that a 1% reduction in HbA1c was associated with a 37% reduction in the risk of microvascular complications. 
----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL STRATEGIES]
Glucose control strategies, such as those used in the UKPDS and ADVANCE studies, have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of microalbuminuria and proteinuria. The ADVANCE study found that intensive therapy based on modified release gliclazide, with other agents added if necessary, was associated with a 9% relative risk reduction in new onset microalbuminuria over 5 years. 
----
[BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL]
Control of hypertension is also crucial in reducing the risk of developing microalbuminuria. The UKPDS study found that tight blood pressure control (achieved mean 144/82 mmHg) compared to less tight control (achieved mean 154/87 mmHg) resulted in a 29% reduction in risk of microalbuminuria over 6 years. 
----
[RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM BLOCKADE]
Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown to be beneficial in preventing diabetic nephropathy. The HOPE and BENEDICT studies found that addition of RAS blockers, such as ramipril and trandolapril, to background antihypertensive therapy reduced the risk of developing proteinuria and microalbuminuria. 
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES PREVENTION]
In type 1 diabetes, intensive glucose control has been shown to reduce the risk of microalbuminuria and proteinuria. The DCCT study found that the relative risk reduction for development of microalbuminuria was 39% and for proteinuria 54% in those allocated to the intensively treated group compared to those in the conventionally managed group over the 6.5-year study.
----
[REVERSING RENAL STRUCTURAL CHANGES]
Very prolonged periods of extremely good control may be necessary to reverse renal structural changes, indicated by microalbuminuria or proteinuria, with some studies showing regression of renal structural changes after 10 years. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown to be effective in reducing the progression of renal disease. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to reduce the odds ratio of progression to persistent proteinuria and increase the odds ratio for regression to normal urinary albumin excretion (UAE). 
----
[ACE INHIBITORS AND RENAL PROTECTION]
ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine and the composite endpoint of death, need for dialysis, or renal transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with proteinuria and hypertension. The addition of an ACE inhibitor to non-ACE inhibitor antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of these endpoints by 48% and 50%, respectively. ACE inhibitors should be offered to all patients with T1DM with abnormal UAE, even if blood pressure (BP) is normal. 
----
[BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL AND DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE]
Tight BP control is crucial in slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, with reduction of BP to <140/80 mmHg reducing the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 10-12 mL/min/year to <5 mL/min/year. Regression from persistent proteinuria to microalbuminuria has been reported, with the fall in GFR reduced to <1 mL/min/year for a substantial time in a significant number of patients. If BP remains >125/75 mmHg on maximum dose of ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), antihypertensive therapy should be intensified. 
----
[TREATMENT TARGETS FOR BLOOD PRESSURE]
Many guidelines now suggest a BP target of 130/80 mmHg for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on the evidence around prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. However, achieved BP in specific renal studies has been around 140/80 mmHg, and the benefits of BP reduction are lost when BP control deteriorates. Tight BP control must be continued long-term to maintain the benefits of reduced risk of microalbuminuria and progression of diabetic kidney disease.
----
[DIABETES NEPHROPATHY TREATMENT]
Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and high urinary albumin excretion (UAE) should be prescribed a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, which should be titrated up to the maximum tolerated dose. Additional antihypertensive therapy may be required to achieve target blood pressure (BP) levels. The choice of additional agents should be made on an individual basis, with diuretics and calcium-channel blockers often being appropriate.

----
[BP CONTROL IN DIABETES NEPHROPATHY]
The guideline target BP in proteinuric patients is < 125/75 mmHg, which can be difficult to reach. Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and ARB does not improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and is associated with more adverse events, including renal dysfunction and failure. Therefore, combination therapy is not advisable, and alternative agents such as direct renin inhibitors or spironolactone may be considered.

----
[LOW PROTEIN DIET IN DIABETES NEPHROPATHY]
Reducing dietary protein intake may non-significantly reduce progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A 6-month trial of dietary restriction may be appropriate, with only those patients who respond continuing thereafter. However, dietary protein intake should not be restricted to < 0.7 g/kg body weight/day.

----
[CARDIOVASCULAR RISK REDUCTION IN DIABETES]
Controlling BP and using RAS blockade can reduce both CVD and renal risk. Aggressive management of modifiable CVD risk factors, including smoking cessation, lipid control, and use of aspirin, can also reduce the risk of CVD events and proteinuria. However, there is limited evidence on the individual effects of these interventions in diabetic kidney disease.

----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Improved glucose control may delay the progression of microalbuminuria. A difference in HbA1c of 6.5% vs 7.3% over 5 years was associated with a relative risk reduction in the development of proteinuria of 21%. Therefore, tight glucose control is an important aspect of managing diabetic nephropathy.
----
[DIABETES MEDICATIONS IN RENAL FAILURE]
The sulfonylureas, such as glibenclamide and gliclazide, are predominantly renally excreted and may require dosage reduction in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In contrast, meglitinides like repaglinide and nateglinide are mostly metabolized by the liver and may be suitable alternatives. Thiazolidenediones, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are also metabolized by the liver but may be limited by fluid retention in end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

----
[ANEMIA IN DIABETES AND CKD]
Anemia is common in people with diabetes and CKD stage 3 or poorer, and investigation is needed to exclude non-renal causes. Anemic patients have a higher mortality rate, higher rates of hospital admission with heart failure, and poorer quality of life. Oral or parenteral iron may be necessary to replete iron stores, and erythropoietin replacement may be considered, although the target treatment level is unclear.

----
[REFERRAL TO NEPHROLOGY]
Patients who begin dialysis as an emergency do less well than those with planned treatment, highlighting the importance of timely referral to nephrology. Intensive management of diabetes, including lifestyle modification and multiple drug combinations, has been shown to have sustained beneficial effects on both cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE]
Monitoring of renal function, including serum creatinine, eGFR, and UAE, should be performed every 3 months, and more often if clinically indicated. In progressive CKD, bone chemistry, full blood count, and iron stores should be assessed 3-6 monthly. Additionally, glucose control should be monitored through self-monitoring of blood glucose and continuous glucose monitoring, as HbA1c results may be misleading in CKD.

----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL IN CKD]
Metformin should be used cautiously in patients with eGFR < 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 and stopped completely when eGFR < 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 due to the risk of lactic acidosis. More reliance should be placed on self-monitoring of blood glucose and continuous glucose monitoring, as albumin turnover is also abnormal in CKD, making interpretation of fructosamine difficult.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY STUDY]
A study of 117 pregnant women with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) found that maintaining blood pressure below 135/85 mmHg and proteinuria below 300 mg/24 hours resulted in longer gestational age and higher birth weight compared to previous studies. The study used methyldopa to control blood pressure. This suggests that tight blood pressure control can have positive outcomes for pregnant women with T1DM. 
----
[RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY REFERRAL]
Referral for renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be considered when serum creatinine levels are between 150-200 μmol/L or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2. Early referral allows for structured physical and psychologic preparation for RRT, as well as specialist management of renal bone disease and anemia. 
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY RISK FACTORS]
Several studies have identified risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy, including duration of diabetes, glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. For example, a study of 2,780 children, adolescents, and adults with Type 1 diabetes found that diabetes duration, A1C, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were all associated with an increased risk of diabetic nephropathy. 
----
[DIABETES CONTROL AND COMPLICATIONS TRIAL]
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) found that intensive therapy can prevent or delay the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. The trial demonstrated the importance of tight blood glucose control in preventing complications of diabetes, including diabetic nephropathy.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY PREVALENCE]
Diabetic nephropathy is a significant complication of diabetes, and its prevalence varies among different populations. Studies have shown that the prevalence of microalbuminuria, an early sign of nephropathy, is higher in certain ethnic groups, such as Indian and African American patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The prevalence of microalbuminuria has been reported to be around 20-30% in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[MICROALBUMINURIA RISK FACTORS]
Several risk factors have been identified for the development of microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, including hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Studies have also shown that the risk of progressing from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria is higher in patients with poor glycemic control and those with a family history of diabetes. Additionally, systolic blood pressure has been shown to relate to the rate of progression of albuminuria in non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY PREDICTION]
Predictors of progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria in non-insulin-dependent diabetes have been identified, including poor glycemic control, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. The Bergamo Nephrologic Diabetes Complications Trial (BENEDICT) investigators have also shown that preventing microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes is possible with early intervention. Long-term renoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition have also been demonstrated in non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY TREATMENT]
Treatment of diabetic nephropathy involves tight blood glucose control, blood pressure management, and lipid lowering. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to have renoprotective effects in patients with diabetes. The effect of irbesartan on the development of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes has also been demonstrated, highlighting the importance of early intervention in preventing the progression of nephropathy.

----
[COMPARISON OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY IN TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Similar risks of nephropathy have been reported in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. An epidemic of proteinuria has been observed in Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes, highlighting the importance of early detection and treatment of diabetic nephropathy in high-risk populations. Intensive therapy has been shown to slow the progression to clinical albuminuria in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY RISK FACTORS]
Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes that can be predicted by various risk factors, including the metabolic syndrome, high-normal levels of albuminuria, and familial clustering of diabetic kidney disease. Studies have shown that the metabolic syndrome is a risk indicator of microvascular and macrovascular complications in diabetes. Additionally, high-normal levels of albuminuria can predict the development of micro- and macroalbuminuria and increased mortality in type 2 diabetic patients.

----
[GENETIC PREDISPOSITION]
Genetic factors also play a role in the development of diabetic nephropathy, with certain ethnic groups being more prone to the condition. Familial clustering of diabetic kidney disease has been observed, and genome-wide scans have identified genetic variants associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate in multi-ethnic diabetic populations. Furthermore, pre-eclampsia has been identified as a risk factor for diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetic women.

----
[INFLAMMATION AND ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION]
Inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are also key factors in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Studies have shown that risk factors related to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are associated with nephropathy and macrovascular complications in diabetes. Additionally, periodontitis has been linked to an increased risk of overt nephropathy and end-stage renal disease in type 2 diabetes.

----
[BIOMARKERS FOR NEPHROPATHY]
Certain biomarkers, such as mannose-binding lectin and osteoprotegerin, have been identified as predictors of microalbuminuria, mortality, and deterioration of kidney function in diabetic patients. These biomarkers may be useful in identifying patients at high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy and in monitoring disease progression.
----
[DIABETES MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Microvascular complications in diabetes can lead to serious health issues, including renal failure, foot ulcers, and lower-extremity amputations. Studies have shown that there is an association between renal failure and foot ulcers or lower-extremity amputations in patients with diabetes. Additionally, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is associated with microalbuminuria in older patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[RENAL FUNCTION MONITORING]
Monitoring kidney function is crucial in patients with diabetes, especially those with incipient and overt nephropathy. Estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is an important aspect of renal function monitoring, and several equations and methods are available, including the modification of diet in renal disease study equation and cystatin C-based methods.

----
[GLOMEMULAR FILTRATION RATE ESTIMATION]
Estimating GFR is essential for predicting renal risk in patients with diabetes. Several studies have evaluated the accuracy and reliability of different equations and methods for estimating GFR, including the Mayo Clinic quadratic equation and cystatin C-based methods. These methods can help healthcare providers monitor kidney function and detect renal function decline in patients with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES-RELATED KIDNEY DISEASE PROGRESSION]
The progression of kidney disease in patients with diabetes can be predicted by combining GFR and albuminuria. Studies have shown that this approach improves the prediction of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Additionally, intensive treatment of diabetes can help prevent the development and progression of microvascular complications, including kidney disease.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY OVERVIEW]
Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to kidney damage and failure. Studies have shown that tight control of blood pressure and blood sugar levels can help prevent or slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Antihypertensive agents, such as ACE inhibitors, have been found to be effective in primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL]
Controlling blood pressure is crucial in managing diabetic nephropathy. Research has demonstrated that long-term follow-up after tight control of blood pressure in type 2 diabetes can have beneficial effects on kidney function. Additionally, studies have shown that strict metabolic control can help slow the progression of incipient nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetes.

----
[ROLE OF ACE INHIBITORS]
ACE inhibitors have been found to be effective in reducing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Meta-analyses have shown that ACE inhibitors can help prevent the onset of microalbuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors can have renoprotective effects in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy.

----
[REVERSAL OF KIDNEY DAMAGE]
In some cases, kidney damage caused by diabetic nephropathy can be reversed. A study found that pancreas transplantation can lead to the reversal of lesions of diabetic nephropathy. Additionally, aggressive control of blood pressure has been shown to lead to remission and regression of kidney damage in type 1 diabetic patients.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Various treatment options are available for managing diabetic nephropathy, including antihypertensive therapy, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has been found to have additive effects in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY TREATMENT]
The effects of spironolactone on nephrin function in patients with diabetic nephropathy have been studied, and it has been found to have beneficial effects. Additionally, intensive multifactorial intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria has been shown to improve renal outcomes. The use of angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors in combination has also been found to be effective in proteinuric renal disease.

----
[RENAL OUTCOMES IN DIABETES]
The ONTARGET study found that renal outcomes with telmisartan, ramipril, or both, were similar in people at high risk. Protein restriction has also been found to be effective in slowing the progression of diabetic renal disease. Intensive multifactorial intervention has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[DIABETES AND PREGNANCY]
Women with type 1 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy, particularly if they have vascular disease. Intrauterine growth abnormalities are also more common in women with type 1 diabetes complicated by vasculopathy. Intensified antihypertensive therapy has been found to improve pregnancy outcomes in type 1 diabetic women with microalbuminuria or diabetic nephropathy.

----
[CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS AND ACE INHIBITORS]
The use of ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has been found to increase the risk of major congenital malformations. This highlights the need for careful consideration of medication use in pregnant women with diabetes.

----
[MULTIFACTORIAL INTERVENTION IN DIABETES]
The Steno 2 Study found that intensive multifactorial intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. This approach involves a combination of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions to manage blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glycemic control.
----
[DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY PREVALENCE]
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is a major health problem that affects approximately one in three people with diabetes, causing excruciating neuropathic pain, substantial morbidity, and impaired quality of life. The prevalence of DPN is around 28-30% in people with diabetes, with emerging evidence suggesting that intermediate hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of DPN. The incidence of DPN is approximately 2% per year. DPN has a significant impact on quality of life, interfering with sleep, daily activities, and enjoyment of life.

----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetic neuropathy is classified based on clinical criteria, with the most widely used classification proposed by Thomas, which differentiates between rapidly reversible, persistent symmetric polyneuropathies, and focal or multifocal neuropathies. Diabetic distal symmetrical sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most relevant clinical manifestation, affecting approximately 30% of community-based people with diabetes. There is no universally accepted classification due to the variety of clinical syndromes and possible overlaps.

----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY TREATMENT]
Treatment of diabetic neuropathy is based on four cornerstones: intensive diabetes therapy and multifactorial risk intervention, treatment based on pathogenic mechanisms, symptomatic treatment, and avoidance of risk factors and complications. Management of chronic painful DPN remains a challenge, requiring careful titration of dosage based on efficacy and side effects, and consideration of potential drug interactions due to frequent polypharmacy in people with diabetes. Analgesic combination therapy may be useful in some cases.

----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY RISK FACTORS]
The most important etiologic factors associated with DPN are poor glycemic control, visceral obesity, diabetes duration, height, hypertension, age, smoking, hypoinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as visceral obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, also play a role in the development and progression of diabetic neuropathy, and need to be prevented or treated. Increased alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for DPN.
----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY CHARACTERISTICS]
Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) typically develops as a "dying-back" neuropathy, affecting the most distal extremities first, and then extends proximally up the limbs. The neuropathic process may also affect the anterior abdominal wall and laterally around the trunk, with occasional involvement of the upper limbs. DPN can present with a "glove and stocking" distribution, and variants include painful small-fiber or pseudosyringomyelic syndromes and an atactic syndrome.

----
[NEUROPATHY FIBER DAMAGE]
Small-fiber unmyelinated (C) and thinly myelinated (A δ) fibers, as well as large-fiber myelinated (A α, A β) neurons, are typically involved in diabetic neuropathy. The reduction or loss of small fiber-mediated sensation results in loss of pain sensation and temperature perception, while large-fiber involvement leads to nerve conduction slowing and reduction or loss of touch, pressure, and vibration sensation.

----
[SYMPTOMS OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Persistent or episodic pain that typically worsens at night and improves during walking is a common symptom of diabetic neuropathy, often described as a deep-seated aching. Sensory fiber involvement causes "positive" sensory symptoms such as paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain, as well as "negative" symptoms such as reduced sensation.

----
[CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHIES]
Diabetic neuropathies can be classified into several types, including rapidly reversible hyperglycemic neuropathy, persistent symmetric polyneuropathies, and focal/multifocal neuropathies. The classification also includes autonomic neuropathies, small-fiber neuropathies, and proximal neuropathies.

----
[CLINICAL IMPACT OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Diabetic neuropathy has a substantial impact on quality of life, particularly by causing considerable interference in sleep and enjoyment of life. Pain associated with diabetic neuropathy persists in the majority of patients with diabetes over periods of several years, with chronic painful DPN present in up to 26% of patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY CHARACTERISTICS]
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is often associated with sudden metabolic changes, short duration of pain or diabetes, preceding weight loss, and less severe sensory loss. Motor involvement is usually less prominent and restricted to the distal lower limbs, resulting in muscle atrophy and weakness at the toes and foot. Ankle reflexes are frequently reduced or absent, and the loss of protective sensation increases the risk of foot complications.

----
[SYMPTOMS OF DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY]
The symptoms of DPN include pain, which can be described as burning, electric, sharp, achy, or tingling, and is often worse at night or when tired or stressed. The pain can be moderate to severe, with an average intensity of 5.75/10 on a 0-10 scale. Allodynia, or pain from a stimulus that does not normally cause pain, may also occur.

----
[COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY]
DPN is a major contributory factor for diabetic foot ulcers, and the lower limb amputation rates in subjects with diabetes are 15 times higher than in the general population. Other potential complications of DPN include osteoarthropathy, osteomyelitis, medial arterial calcification, and neuropathic edema.

----
[CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY]
The clinical presentation of DPN can vary, but common locations of pain include the feet, balls of feet, toes, and hands. The symptoms may be accompanied by sensory loss, but patients with severe pain may have few clinical signs. Pain may persist over several years, causing considerable disability and impaired quality of life, or it may remit partially or completely.
----
[OCULOMOTOR COMPLICATIONS]
Pain associated with oculomotor complications in diabetes is typically felt behind and above the eye, and may precede ptosis and diplopia by several days. The symptoms reach their nadir within a day or a few days and then gradually improve, with full resolution usually occurring within 3-5 months. The fourth, sixth, and seventh cranial nerves are most commonly affected. 
----
[MONONEUROPATHY OF THE LIMBS]
Mononeuropathy of the limbs, particularly the ulnar, median, radial, and peroneal nerves, can be painful, especially if of acute onset. Entrapment neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, can also cause painful paresthesia. 
----
[DIABETIC TRUNCAL NEUROPATHY]
Diabetic truncal neuropathy presents with abrupt onset of pain or dysesthesia, often accompanied by cutaneous sensory impairment or hyperesthesia. The pain is typically unilateral, deep, and aching, and can be confused with pain of pulmonary, cardiac, or gastrointestinal origin. Weight loss is common, and the course of the condition is usually favorable, with pain subsiding within months to 1.5-2 years. 
----
[DIABETIC AMYOTROPHY]
Diabetic amyotrophy is characterized by asymmetric or symmetric proximal muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the lower limbs. Pain is nearly universal, deep, aching, and constant, and is often worse at night. The pain can be severe and tenacious but has a good prognosis with treatment. 
----
[ACUTE PAINFUL NEUROPATHY]
Acute painful neuropathy is a separate clinical entity that presents with continuous burning pain, particularly in the soles, with nocturnal exacerbation. A characteristic feature is cutaneous contact discomfort to clothes and sheets, which can be objectified as hypersensitivity. This condition is encountered infrequently in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DETECTION]
Early detection of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by screening is of paramount importance, as many patients with DPN are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms. Appropriate screening and preventative measures can potentially prevent the majority of amputations.
----
[DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY]
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is a complication of diabetes that affects the nervous system, leading to damage to the peripheral nerves. This can result in symptoms such as numbness, pain, and weakness in the affected areas. DPN can also lead to other complications, including diabetic truncal neuropathy and diabetic amyotrophy.

----
[CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION]
Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction is a relatively under-studied aspect of diabetes, but research has shown that people with diabetes can experience diffuse degenerative lesions in the CNS, including demyelination and loss of axon cylinders. This can lead to cognitive dysfunction and other neurological problems. Studies have yielded variable results, but some have shown that the degree of dysfunction depends on the stage of peripheral neuropathy.

----
[NEUROIMAGING AND DIAGNOSIS]
Neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to diagnose and study DPN. These techniques have shown reduced cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with DPN, as well as an increased frequency of subcortical and brainstem lesions. This information can be useful in understanding the underlying mechanisms of DPN and developing effective treatments.

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Diabetic neuropathy can manifest in different ways, including diabetic truncal neuropathy, which leads to herniation of the oblique abdominal muscle, and diabetic amyotrophy, which causes pronounced bilateral atrophy and paresis of the quadriceps muscle. Weight loss is also a common feature of diabetic neuropathy, with some patients experiencing weight loss of up to 35-40 pounds.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES FOR DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
The Consensus Development Conference on Standardized Measures in Diabetic Neuropathy recommends five measures to diagnose diabetic neuropathy: clinical measures, morphologic and biochemical analyses, electrodiagnostic assessment, quantitative sensory testing, and autonomic nervous system testing. Clinical measures include a general medical history, neurologic history, and examination of sensory, motor, and reflex functions. These measures help assess the severity of neuropathy and its impact on daily life. 

----
[CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Clinical assessment of diabetic neuropathy involves a comprehensive evaluation, including a general medical and neurologic history, inspection of the feet, and neurologic examination of sensation, motor function, and reflexes. Simple semi-quantitative bedside instruments, such as the 10g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, can be used to assess sensation. The normal range for the tuning fork on the dorsal distal joint of the great toe varies by age, and an indicator test for sudomotor dysfunction is the Neuropad, which assesses plantar sweat production.

----
[STANDARDIZED SCORES FOR NEUROPATHY ASSESSMENT]
Standardized scores, such as the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, Neuropathy Symptom Score, and Neuropathy Disability Score, can be used to assess the severity of symptoms and neuropathic deficits. These scores are reproducible and can help diagnose neuropathy. The minimum criteria for the clinical diagnosis of neuropathy include moderate signs with or without symptoms or mild signs with moderate symptoms.

----
[PATHOGENETIC MECHANISMS OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Recent experimental studies suggest a multifactorial pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy, involving pathophysiologic, pathobiochemical, and structural abnormalities. Two approaches have been used to clarify the pathogenesis: characterizing the abnormalities that result in experimental diabetic neuropathy and employing therapeutic interventions to prevent or halt the progression of these alterations. The exact mechanisms are still being researched, but evidence suggests that neuropathic involvement at central and spinal levels is a feature of diabetic neuropathy.
----
[DIABETES NEUROPATHY ASSESSMENT]
Bedside tests can be used to assess large and small fiber function in patients with diabetes. The Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork and 10 g Monofilament are examples of tests used to evaluate large fiber function. These tests help healthcare providers diagnose and monitor diabetic neuropathy, a common complication of diabetes. 

----
[DIABETES NEUROPATHY DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS]
Figure 38.7 illustrates the bedside tests used for assessing large and small fiber function, providing a visual guide for healthcare providers to perform these tests. The tests for large fiber function, such as the Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork, and those for small fiber function, can help identify nerve damage in patients with diabetes. Early detection of neuropathy is crucial for timely intervention and prevention of further complications.
----
[DIAGNOSING DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Diagnosing diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) requires more than just the presence of neuropathic symptoms, as early stages or small-fiber neuropathy may not exhibit noticeable deficits. Sophisticated tests such as thermal thresholds or skin biopsy may be necessary to verify the condition. The intensity and course of neuropathic pain should be assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale or a visual analog scale.

----
[SCREENING TOOLS FOR NEUROPATHIC PAIN]
Various screening tools, including the PainDetect, LANSS, NPQ, DN-4, and ID-Pain questionnaires, have been developed to identify neuropathic pain in patients with diabetes. These tools use verbal descriptors and pain qualities to distinguish neuropathic pain from other types of chronic pain, such as nociceptive pain.

----
[RED FLAGS FOR ALTERNATIVE CAUSES OF NEUROPATHY]
Certain findings should alert physicians to consider alternative causes of neuropathy beyond diabetes, including pronounced asymmetry of neurologic deficits, predominant motor deficits, rapid development or progression of neuropathic impairments, and progression despite optimal glycemic control. These cases may require a detailed neurologic work-up.

----
[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES FOR NEUROPATHY]
The most important differential diagnoses for neuropathy from a general medicine perspective include neuropathies caused by alcohol abuse, uremia, hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, peripheral arterial disease, paraneoplastic syndromes, inflammatory and infectious diseases, and neurotoxic drugs. Clinical measures are used to establish the presence or absence of neurologic dysfunction in diabetes.
----
[DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DIAGNOSIS]
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed using quantitative sensory testing (QST) to exclude non-neuropathic causes of neurologic dysfunction, eliminate non-diabetic causes of neuropathy, and distinguish between different forms of diabetic neuropathy. QST can also monitor progression and provide a clinical correlate of outcome in trials. However, clinical measures have limitations, including lack of sensitivity to change and limited reliability and reproducibility.

----
[QUANTITATIVE SENSORY TESTING LIMITATIONS]
Quantitative sensory testing has limitations, including the potential for positive symptoms to reflect different pathophysiology than deficits. As a result, symptom or pain scores should not be used to evaluate the overall presence or progression of diabetic neuropathy, but rather to assess pain severity. This distinction is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

----
[ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC MEASURES]
Electrodiagnostic measures, such as electrophysiologic techniques, offer an objective, sensitive, and reproducible method for diagnosing diabetic neuropathy. These measures are widely available in neurophysiologic laboratories worldwide and can provide valuable information about nerve function. However, they also have limitations, including measuring only function in the largest, fastest-conducting myelinated fibers.

----
[ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC MEASURES LIMITATIONS]
Electrodiagnostic measures have several limitations, including relatively low specificity in detecting diabetic neuropathy, high intra-individual variability for certain variables, and vulnerability to external factors such as electrode locations or limb temperature. Additionally, these measures provide only indirect information about symptoms and deficits, highlighting the need for a comprehensive diagnostic approach.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Sural nerve biopsy is not a routine method for diagnosing diabetic neuropathy, but it can be used to establish a diagnosis when the etiology of the neuropathy is uncertain. However, this technique has limitations, including no direct benefit to the patient and potential complications. Skin biopsy, on the other hand, has become a widely used tool to investigate small caliber sensory nerves in peripheral neuropathies. 
----
[SKIN BIOPSY GUIDELINES]
The European Federation of Neurological Societies has developed guidelines for the use of skin biopsy in diagnosing peripheral neuropathies, recommending a 3-mm punch skin biopsy at the distal leg and quantifying the linear density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers. The guideline suggests using bright-field immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence with antiprotein gene product 9.5 antibody. 
----
[QUANTITATIVE SENSORY TESTING]
Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a method used to determine the absolute sensory threshold, and it can be used to characterize cutaneous sensation in patients with diabetic neuropathy. The Peripheral Nerve Society recommends using detection thresholds of touch-pressure, vibration, coolness, warmth, heat pain, cold pain, and mechanical pain to assess cutaneous sensation. 
----
[QST PROCEDURES AND LIMITATIONS]
QST procedures include the method of limits, threshold tracking, titration method, and two-alternative forced-choice method. The advantages of QST techniques include high sensitivity, simplicity, and non-invasiveness, but limitations include vulnerability to psychophysical effects, high intra-individual variability, and lack of standardization.
----
[DIABETES THERAPY GOALS]
The goal of diabetes therapy should be to achieve normal glycemia as early as possible in as many patients as is safely possible, rather than aiming for a specific HbA1c threshold within the diabetic range. Intensive diabetes therapy is associated with a moderately increased risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia. This approach is particularly relevant for patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Achieving optimal glycemic control is crucial in preventing long-term complications.

----
[INTENSIVE THERAPY EFFECTIVENESS IN T2DM]
In patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), intensive glucose control has shown limited benefits in preventing or slowing the progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Studies such as the UKPDS, ADVANCE, and VADT have found no significant differences in the rates of DPN or microvascular complications between intensive and standard glucose control groups. These findings suggest that intensive therapy may not be as effective in preventing DPN in T2DM patients.

----
[MULTIFACTORIAL INTERVENTION]
The Steno 2 study demonstrated that intensified multifactorial risk intervention, including intensive diabetes treatment, ACE inhibitors, antioxidants, statins, aspirin, and smoking cessation, had a positive effect on autonomic neuropathy and other microvascular complications such as diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. However, this approach did not have a significant effect on the progression of DPN. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing diabetes and its complications.

----
[SKIN BIOPSY FOR DIAGNOSIS]
Punch skin biopsy is a safe and reliable technique for diagnosing small-fiber sensory neuropathy. Quantification of intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density closely correlates with warm and heat pain threshold and appears more sensitive than sensory nerve conduction study and sural nerve biopsy. This technique has high diagnostic efficiency and predictive values, making it a valuable tool in the diagnosis and management of peripheral neuropathy.

----
[TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Several long-term prospective studies have assessed the effects of intensive diabetes therapy on the prevention and progression of chronic diabetic complications, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy. While the DCCT and UKPDS were not specifically designed to evaluate the effects of intensive therapy on DPN, they provide valuable insights into the importance of glycemic control in preventing long-term complications. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of intensive therapy in preventing and treating DPN.
----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY TREATMENT]
α-lipoic acid has been shown to reduce the symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), including pain, paresthesias, and numbness, in a clinically meaningful way. In a multicenter randomized double-masked parallel-group clinical trial, patients with stage 1 or stage 2a DPN who received 600 mg of α-lipoic acid four times daily for 4 years showed improvement in some neuropathic deficits and symptoms. The treatment was well-tolerated throughout the trial. Clinical and post-marketing surveillance studies have revealed a highly favorable safety profile for α-lipoic acid.

----
[PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OF PAINFUL NEUROPATHY]
Painful symptoms in DPN can be challenging to manage, and simple analgesics are often inadequate to control the pain. Effective pain treatment requires a balance between pain relief and side effects, and patients should be offered available therapies in a stepwise fashion. The appropriate and effective drug should be tried and identified in each patient by carefully titrating the dosage based on efficacy and side effects. A rational treatment algorithm including various causal and symptomatic options can be used to guide treatment decisions.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR PAINFUL DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Certain antidepressants (tricyclic drugs, duloxetine) and anticonvulsants (pregabalin, gabapentin) are considered first-line treatments for painful diabetic neuropathy, while opioids are recommended as second-line options. The advantages and disadvantages of various drugs and drug classes used for treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy should be considered, taking into account co-morbidities and complications associated with diabetes. A diagnosis of the underlying neuropathic manifestation should be established before making treatment decisions.

----
[MEASURING THERAPEUTIC EFFECT]
The relative benefit of an active treatment over placebo treatment in clinical trials is often expressed as the relative risk, relative risk reduction, or odds ratio. However, to estimate the extent of a therapeutic effect, such as pain relief, that can be translated into clinical practice, a simple measure can be used to help physicians select the appropriate treatment. This can help guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.
----
[DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Treatment options for painful diabetic neuropathy include optimal diabetes control through lifestyle modification, oral antidiabetic drugs, and insulin, with a goal of achieving an HbA1c level of ≤6.5% (48 mmol/mol). Pathogenetically oriented treatment options include α-lipoic acid, while symptomatic treatment options include tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants. The choice of treatment depends on various factors, including the presence of co-morbidities and potential side effects.
----
[SYMPOMATIC TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Symptomatic treatment options for painful diabetic neuropathy include first-line treatments such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., duloxetine). Second-line treatments include weak opioids (e.g., tramadol) and local treatments (e.g., capsaicin cream). Strong opioids (e.g., oxycodone) may be considered for pain resistant to standard pharmacotherapy.
----
[TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS]
When selecting a treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy, consideration should be given to frequent co-morbidities and potential side effects. For example, duloxetine and pregabalin may be favorable for patients with depression or generalized anxiety disorder, while tricyclics may be unfavorable for patients with coronary heart disease or autonomic neuropathy. The potential for drug interactions and effects on fasting glucose levels should also be considered.
----
[ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Additional treatment options for painful diabetic neuropathy include invasive procedures such as electrical spinal cord stimulation, which may be considered for patients who do not respond to standard pharmacotherapy. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may also be an option for some patients. These treatments typically require specialist referral and may have varying degrees of efficacy and safety.
----
[NEUROPATHIC PAIN TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Neuropathic pain in diabetes can be treated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), but their use is limited due to high rates of adverse events and contraindications. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been considered as an alternative, but they have shown limited efficacy in treating neuropathic pain. Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine and venlafaxine have shown promise in reducing pain intensity. 
----
[SNRI EFFICACY AND SAFETY]
Duloxetine has been evaluated in three controlled studies and has been shown to significantly reduce 24-hour pain intensity compared to placebo, with response rates of 48.2% and 47.2% for 120 mg/day and 60 mg/day, respectively. The most frequent side effects of duloxetine include nausea, somnolence, dizziness, and constipation, which are usually mild to moderate and transient. Duloxetine does not cause weight gain, but may cause a small increase in fasting blood glucose. 
----
[VENLAFAXINE EFFICACY AND SAFETY]
Venlafaxine has been shown to have an analgesic effect in a 6-week trial, with response rates of 56% and 39% for 150-225 mg and 75 mg, respectively. The most common adverse events were tiredness, and the effect of venlafaxine was attributed to an analgesic rather than antidepressant effect. 
----
[NUMBER NEEDED TO TREAT]
The number needed to treat (NNT) is a practical measure that represents the number of patients that need to be treated with a particular therapy to observe a clinically relevant effect or adverse event in one patient. The NNT is expressed as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction and can be used to evaluate the efficacy of individual agents used in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
----
[DIABETES NEUROPATHY TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Lacosamide is a medication that has been evaluated in several studies for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, although it has not been approved by the FDA or EMEA for this condition. Topical capsaicin has been shown to significantly reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. Opioids, such as tramadol, can also be used to treat neuropathic pain in diabetes. Anticonvulsants, like gabapentin, are another option for managing painful diabetic neuropathy.

----
[CAPSAICIN TREATMENT FOR NEUROPATHY]
Capsaicin is an alkaloid found in red peppers that depletes tissues of substance P, reducing neurogenic plasma extravasation and pain. Studies have demonstrated significant pain reduction and improvement in quality of life in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy after 8 weeks of treatment with capsaicin cream. However, treatment should be restricted to a maximum of 8 weeks to avoid adverse effects on sensory function.

----
[OPIOID TREATMENT FOR NEUROPATHY]
Tramadol is an opioid that can be used to treat neuropathic pain in diabetes, with a low risk of tolerance and dependence. In clinical trials, tramadol has been shown to provide significant pain relief in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, with common adverse events including nausea and constipation. Strong opioids, such as oxycodone, may be required for more severe pain.

----
[ANTICONVULSANT TREATMENT FOR NEUROPATHY]
Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that can be used to treat painful diabetic neuropathy, with mechanisms of action involving interaction with the L-amino acid transporter and binding to the α2-δ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of gabapentin in reducing pain in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, although the exact mechanisms of action are not fully understood.
----
[PSYCHOLOGIC SUPPORT FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT]
A psychologic component to pain should not be underestimated in patients with diabetes, and addressing concerns and anxieties is essential for successful management of neuropathic pain. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes or those experiencing painful symptoms due to intensive insulin treatment may experience remission of severe pain. A supportive approach can help alleviate pain and improve patient outcomes.

----
[PHYSICAL MEASURES FOR PAIN RELIEF]
Physical measures such as cold water immersion, wearing silk pyjamas, or using a bed cradle can help relieve pain in patients with neuropathic pain. Comfortable footwear can also benefit patients who experience painful symptoms while walking. These simple measures can provide relief and improve quality of life for patients with diabetes.

----
[ACUPUNCTURE FOR PAIN RELIEF]
Acupuncture has shown significant pain relief in patients with diabetes, with 77% of patients experiencing relief after up to six courses of traditional Chinese acupuncture. A follow-up study found that 67% of patients were able to stop or significantly reduce their medications, and only 24% required further acupuncture treatment. However, controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.

----
[ELECTRICAL STIMULATION FOR PAIN RELIEF]
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been shown to influence neuronal afferent transmission and conduction velocity, increasing the nociceptive flexion reflex threshold and changing somatosensory evoked potentials. TENS has been found to provide significant pain relief in patients with diabetes, and can be used as an adjunctive modality combined with pharmacotherapy to augment pain relief.

----
[OPIOIDS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT]
Opioids, such as controlled-release oxycodone, can be effective in managing pain in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (DPN) who are unresponsive to standard treatments. However, careful selection of patients, regular monitoring, and management of possible opioid-specific problems are essential to ensure safe and effective use. Combination therapy with opioids and other medications, such as gabapentin, may also be effective in managing pain.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a complication of diabetes that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that neuropathy is related to increased mortality in diabetic patients, with a survival analysis using an accelerated failure time model demonstrating this relationship. Additionally, neuropathy can lead to diabetic neuropathic foot ulceration, which is a significant risk factor for amputation and other complications.

----
[NEUROPATHY RISK FACTORS]
Several risk factors have been identified for the development of diabetic neuropathy, including abdominal obesity, macroangiopathy, and poor glucose control. The MONICA/KORA Augsburg Surveys S2 and S3 found that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of neuropathy, and that this risk is independent of other factors such as age and sex. Other studies have also identified neuropathy as a risk factor for mortality in type II diabetes.

----
[NEUROPATHY PREVALENCE]
The prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy varies depending on the population being studied, but it is estimated to affect up to 50% of people with diabetes. Studies have shown that the prevalence of painful diabetic neuropathy is significant, with one study finding that 24.5% of people with type 2 diabetes reported painful neuropathy. The impact of neuropathy on quality of life is also significant, with many people experiencing chronic pain and disability.

----
[NEUROPATHY TYPES]
There are several types of diabetic neuropathy, including chronic and remitting painful neuropathy, and acute painful neuropathy. Each type has distinct characteristics and requires different treatment approaches. For example, chronic painful neuropathy is often treated with medications such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants, while acute painful neuropathy may require more aggressive treatment, including hospitalization and pain management.
----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY DIAGNOSIS]
Diabetic neuropathy can be diagnosed using various methods, including quantitative sensory testing, thermal perception, and vibration threshold measurement. The Neuropen and NeuroQuick are examples of devices used for assessing peripheral nerve function. Early recognition of diabetic neuropathy is crucial for effective management and treatment.

----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY PREVALENCE]
The prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the United Kingdom hospital clinic population has been studied, with results showing a significant number of patients affected. A multicentre study found that 150 out of 648 patients with diabetes had peripheral neuropathy. This highlights the importance of regular screening and assessment for neuropathy in patients with diabetes.

----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT]
Intensive treatment of diabetes has been shown to reduce the development and progression of long-term complications, including diabetic neuropathy. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated the benefits of intensive blood glucose control in reducing the risk of complications. Effective management of diabetic neuropathy involves a combination of good blood glucose control, regular screening, and prompt treatment of any symptoms or complications that arise.

----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY SCREENING TOOLS]
Various screening tools are available to identify neuropathic pain and diagnose diabetic neuropathy, including the Neuropad test for sudomotor function and quantitative sensory testing. The European Federation of Neurological Societies has published guidelines on the use of skin biopsy in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. These tools can help healthcare professionals to identify patients with diabetic neuropathy and provide appropriate treatment and management.
----
[DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be treated with various medications, including duloxetine, venlafaxine, gabapentin, and pregabalin, which have been shown to be effective in reducing pain. These medications have been studied in numerous clinical trials, demonstrating their efficacy and safety in patients with diabetic neuropathy.

[EFFECTIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES]
Alternative therapies such as high-frequency external muscle stimulation, frequency-modulated electromagnetic neural stimulation, and electrical spinal-cord stimulation have also been shown to be effective in treating painful diabetic neuropathy. These therapies can provide significant pain relief and improve sensation in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of these alternative therapies.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF MULTIMODAL TREATMENT APPROACH]
A multimodal treatment approach, combining different therapies and treatments, may be the most effective way to manage diabetic neuropathy. This approach can include a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as medication, physical therapy, and alternative therapies. A comprehensive treatment plan can help to improve symptoms, reduce pain, and improve quality of life for patients with diabetic neuropathy.

----
[NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH]

[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Diabetes accounts for 75-90% of excess coronary artery disease risk seen in people with diabetes and enhances the effects of other cardiovascular risk factors. The link between glucose control and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not as strong as that seen with microvascular complications of diabetes. A range of hemodynamic and metabolic factors contribute to macrovascular disease in diabetes. 

----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Macrovascular complications develop in patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and are a particular concern due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes in adolescents and younger adults. Diabetes itself accounts for 75-90% of the excess coronary artery disease (CAD) risk and enhances the effects of other cardiovascular risk factors. Death from stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading causes of mortality in T1DM and T2DM.

----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL AND VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
There is clear evidence that glucose exerts direct and indirect toxic effects on the vasculature, and that glycemic memory describes the deferred long-term injurious effects of prior glycemic status. Early glycemic control appears to be important to reduce vascular complications in subsequent decades. Specific insulin resistance pathways also appear to contribute to atherogenesis in diabetes.

----
[TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
A multifactorial approach treating conventional cardiovascular risk factors as well as diabetes-specific risk factors is currently viewed as the optimal strategy to reduce the burden of CVD in diabetes. Treatments that reduce oxidative stress and inhibit inflammation, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonists, have been shown to be anti-atherosclerotic in experimental studies. Inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) have consistently demonstrated reduced endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in animal models.
----
[DIABETES AND MACROVASCULAR DISEASE]
The link between HbA1c levels and macrovascular disease is not as strong as it is with microvascular complications. An increase in HbA1c from 5.5% to 9.5% results in a 10-fold increase in microvascular disease endpoints, but only a twofold increase in macrovascular disease endpoints. Clinical trials have investigated the association between tight glycemic control and cardiovascular endpoints, with mixed results. The risk of macrovascular disease is a significant concern for individuals with diabetes.

----
[CLINICAL TRIALS AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Clinical trials such as the ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT trials have explored the effects of tight glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. These trials have found that tight blood glucose control has little effect on macrovascular outcomes, and may even have deleterious effects. The duration of these trials may be a factor, as longer-term follow-up studies have shown benefits of intensive glucose control. Other risk factor modification strategies need to be emphasized in addition to glucose control.

----
[GLYROTOXICITY AND VASCULAR DAMAGE]
Hyperglycemia is thought to have direct and indirect toxic effects on vascular cells, contributing to glucose-mediated vascular injury in diabetes. Increased glucose levels can lead to heightened formation of diacylglycerol and contribute to atherosclerosis. Studies in cell culture experiments have shown that hyperglycemia induces pro-atherogenic effects, and novel factors such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) have been implicated in diabetic macrovascular disease.

----
[PATHOGENESIS OF DIABETIC MACROVASCULAR DISEASE]
Atherosclerosis is initiated by the adhesion of monocytes to the vascular wall, followed by transmigration of monocytes into the subendothelial space. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which accumulate in the vascular wall and contribute to the formation of fatty streak lesions and advanced lesions. Understanding the pathogenesis of diabetic macrovascular disease is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Early glycemic control is crucial for a long-term beneficial outcome on diabetic complications. Studies such as the UKPDS in T2DM and the VADT study have shown that poor glycemic control is associated with an increased subsequent burden of complications. The concept of "metabolic memory" suggests that hyperglycemia may expose patients to harmful effects years before T2DM is diagnosed. Therefore, early diagnosis and strict glycemic control may be pivotal to reduce the induction of this metabolic memory.

----
[MECHANISMS UNDERLYING METABOLIC MEMORY]
The mechanisms underlying metabolic memory include the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), glycation of DNA, increased flux of glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial stress. These pathways can lead to increased oxidative damage, overproduction of PKC-β, and epigenetic changes. Transient hyperglycemia can induce long-lasting activation of epigenetic changes, which can be prevented by reducing mitochondrial superoxide production.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA-INDUCED CELLULAR CHANGES]
Hyperglycemia can directly activate monocytes-macrophages, initiating increased expression of cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-6. This leads to protein kinase C (PKC) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation, resulting in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Auto-oxidation of glucose can also lead to the formation of ROS and can mediate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation.

----
[ANIMAL MODELS FOR DIABETES-ASSOCIATED MACROVASCULAR DISEASE]
Animal models, such as the apoE knockout (KO) mouse rendered diabetic by multiple low doses of streptozotocin injections, have been developed to study macrovascular disease in diabetes. This model is considered an appropriate model to study macrovascular disease in diabetes by the National Institutes of Health/Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (NIH/JDRF) co-sponsored Animal Models for Diabetes Complications Consortium (AMDCC).
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND ATHEROGENESIS]
Insulin resistance impairs nitric oxide (NO) production, which is mediated via the PI3K signal transduction pathway, and this impairment contributes to the pro-atherogenic effects of insulin. In contrast, hyperinsulinemia stimulates the Ras/Raf/MEKK/MAPK signal transduction pathway, leading to increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Additionally, IL-6 decreases insulin-stimulated NO production from endothelial cells, while increasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. This paradoxical effect of IL-6 suggests that insulin resistance contributes to atherogenesis.

----
[AGE FORMATION AND PROPERTIES]
Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) form from early glycation products, such as Schiff bases and Amadori products, which undergo further enzymatic modifications to produce reactive intermediates like methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal reacts with amino, sulfhydryl, and guanidine functional groups in proteins, causing browning, denaturation, and cross-linking between lysine residues. AGE-based cross-links are resistant to enzymatic degradation and are very stable. The rate of AGE formation depends on factors like ambient sugar concentrations, oxidative stress, and exposure duration.

----
[DIRECT EFFECTS OF VASCULAR AGE ACCUMULATION]
Vascular accumulation of AGEs directly influences endothelial function and enhances the evolution of macrovascular disease. AGEs mediate their effects through direct and receptor-mediated mechanisms, leading to changes in protein structure and function, and degradation of proteins. AGE accumulation on proteins like collagen, albumin, and apolipoproteins disrupts matrix-matrix and matrix-cell interactions, reducing vascular elasticity and compliance. Additionally, AGEs quench NO and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by stimulating NADPH oxidase activity.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA AND PERSISTENT ATHEROGENIC EFFECTS]
Hyperglycemia causes persistent atherogenic effects during subsequent normoglycemia by inducing long-lasting changes in chromatin remodeling. Specifically, hyperglycemia recruits the histone methyl transferase Set7, leading to increased expression of pro-atherogenic pathways, including monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). This results in persistent upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes, even after return to normoglycemia.
----
[AGE CROSS-LINK BREAKERS]
The thiazolium compound ALT-711 has been shown to cleave pre-formed AGEs, reversing diabetes-induced increases in large artery stiffness and reducing vascular and cardiac AGE accumulation. This has been demonstrated in diabetic rats, where treatment with ALT-711 was associated with increased collagen solubility and reduced vascular AGE accumulation. Additionally, alagebrium has been shown to prevent the progression of nephropathy, possibly via direct inhibition of PKC-α phosphorylation.

----
[RECEPTOR-MEDIATED EFFECTS OF AGES]
The receptor-mediated effects of AGEs occur via binding to proteins such as RAGE, AGE-R1, AGE-R2, and AGE-R3, as well as macrophage scavenger receptors like CD-36. The interaction between AGEs and these receptors has been postulated to promote atherosclerosis, with studies using CD36-knockout mice supporting this view. The exact roles of AGE-R1, AGE-R2, and AGE-R3 have not been fully elucidated.

----
[RAGE AND ITS ROLE IN DIABETIC MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
RAGE is a multiligand signal transduction receptor that acts as a pattern recognition receptor, promoting leukocyte recruitment and extravasation of infiltrating cells. RAGE is found on endothelial cells and monocytes-macrophages, and has been implicated in inflammatory lesions in many disorders, including diabetic macrovascular complications.

----
[DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF RAGE ACTIVATION]
Engagement of RAGE leads to activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF κ B, activating various signaling pathways, including NADPH oxidase, MAPKs, and PKC. This can cause activation and translocation of NF κ B, leading to increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes. RAGE expression itself can also be induced by NF κ B, creating a positive feedback loop.

----
[STUDIES REDUCING VASCULAR AGE ACCUMULATION]
Pharmacologic interventions, such as aminoguanidine, have been used to reduce the accumulation of AGEs via decreasing the total AGE load or via chemical modification of existing AGEs into inactive forms. These interventions have shown promise in reducing vascular AGE accumulation and preventing the progression of diabetic macrovascular complications.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetes complications, such as macrovascular complications, are multifactorial in origin and involve interactions between hemodynamic pathways and metabolic pathways. The interaction between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) plays a crucial role in the development of these complications. AGE accumulation can induce an upregulation of certain components of the RAS, contributing to disease progression. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing effective therapeutic interventions.

----
[RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM]
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a complex pathway that plays a critical role in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance. The classic RAS pathway involves the generation of angiotensin I and II, which can also occur in vascular and other tissues. Recent discoveries have expanded our understanding of the RAS, including the identification of ACE2, a carboxypeptidase that generates angiotensin 1-7, a heptapeptide with vasodilatory and growth inhibitory effects.

----
[RAGE AND DIABETES]
The receptor for advanced glycosylation end-products (RAGE) is a key player in the development of diabetes-related complications. RAGE antagonism has shown promise in reducing inflammation and fibrosis, and several RAGE-neutralizing compounds are currently in clinical trials. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent, with studies demonstrating its ability to suppress atherosclerosis and reduce plaque complexity in diabetic models.

----
[THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS]
Several therapeutic interventions have been shown to exert anti-atherosclerotic effects via inhibition of the AGE/RAGE pathway. These include angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and PPAR-γ agonists, and statins. Additionally, ACE inhibition has been reported to confer end-organ protective effects, partly via a reduction in AGEs and an increase in sRAGE. These findings highlight the potential for targeting the RAS and AGE/RAGE pathways in the prevention and treatment of diabetes-related complications.
----
[RENIN ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM OVERVIEW]
The renin angiotensin system (RAS) is a complex enzymatic cascade that plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance. The classic pathway involves the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by renin, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II acts through several receptor subtypes, including AT1 and AT2 receptors. 
----
[CLASSIC VS UPDATED VIEW OF RAS]
The classic view of the RAS emphasizes the role of angiotensin II in vasoconstriction, sodium reabsorption, and hypertrophy/hyperplasia. In contrast, the updated view highlights the importance of alternative pathways, including the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9 by ACE2, and the subsequent generation of angiotensin 1-7, which acts as a vasodilator through the Mas receptor.
----
[ROLE OF ACE2 IN RAS]
ACE2 plays a crucial role in the RAS by degrading angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9 and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, which has vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects. Further research is needed to understand the functions of ACE2 inside and outside the RAS.
----
[ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTORS]
The effects of angiotensin peptides are mediated through specific cell surface receptors, including AT1 and AT2 receptors. The AT1 receptor mediates most of the effects associated with angiotensin II, while the role of the AT2 receptor remains controversial but may antagonize certain effects of AT1 receptor-mediated actions.
----

Increased concentrations of these cells have been associated with favorable cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to increase the number of regenerative endothelial progenitor cells, contributing to beneficial cardiovascular effects. 
----
[AT1-7 AND ACE2 IN ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION]
The disruption of the ACE-ACE2 balance may result in abnormal blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against hypertension. AT1-7, generated by the enzyme ACE2, promotes the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins, and inhibits growth of vascular smooth muscle cells, platelet aggregation, and thrombosis. AT1-7 may antagonize the effects of angiotensin II, leading to restoration of endothelial function. 
----
[RAS ACTIVATION AND ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION]
Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by an imbalance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, associated with decreased nitric oxide activity and increased angiotensin II and endothelin activity. The activation of the RAS is crucial to the pathogenesis of diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction, with increased expression and activity of ACE, angiotensin II, and AT1 receptors in the aortic wall of diabetic mice. 
----
[DIABETES-INDUCED ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION]
Diabetes mellitus is associated with various factors that contribute to endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction, vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, inflammation, and thrombosis. The release of chemokines, cytokines, and cellular adhesion molecules also plays a role in the development of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes.
----
[PATHOGENESIS OF MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
The pathogenesis of macrovascular complications in diabetes involves an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, which has a central role in the development of atherosclerosis. The increase in ACE2 expression and activity in response to injury may be an attempt to protect the vessel, but the exact mechanism is not clear. RAS blockade has been shown to reduce remodeling and improve survival in humans after a myocardial infarction.

----
[ROLE OF OXIDATIVE STRESS IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS]
Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerosis, particularly in the diabetic milieu. Increased vascular superoxide production and NAD(P)H oxidase activity have been demonstrated in diabetic atherosclerotic mice, and interventions that reduce vascular superoxide production have been associated with reduced plaque formation. The deletion of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase has been shown to increase plaque area and inflammatory mediators in diabetic mice.

----
[THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS OF RAS BLOCKADE]
RAS blockade has emerged as a therapeutic target for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in diabetes. Clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibition improves endothelial function in subjects with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) such as losartan have been shown to improve endothelial function by counteracting the actions of angiotensin II at the endothelial level.

----
[ROLE OF RAS ACTIVATION IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS]
Activation of the RAS is central to the development of atherosclerosis, and clinical and experimental evidence suggests that RAS activation contributes to the increased production of local angiotensin II, which participates in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The accumulation of ACE protein within the atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries suggests that ACE may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
The RENAAL study has shown that treatment with losartan in patients with type 2 diabetes, nephropathy, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) reduced cardiovascular risk to levels similar to those observed in patients without LVH. The ONTARGET study also demonstrated that the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan provides a benefit similar to that of the ACE inhibitor ramipril in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes with end-organ damage. An ACE inhibitor or ARB is an initial antihypertensive agent of choice in patients with diabetes due to their capacity to prevent or retard the development of diabetic macrovascular complications.
----
[ENDOTHELIN SYSTEM]
Endothelin (ET) is a potent vasoconstrictor that plays a role in diabetic macrovascular complications. There are three distinct ET genes that encode different mature ET sequences, and ET-1 is predominantly present in endothelial cells. ET-1 stimulates the production and release of inflammatory cytokines from monocytes and enhances the uptake of LDL cholesterol by these cells, promoting a phenotypic change into foam cells.
----
[ROLE OF ENDOTHELIN IN DIABETIC MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Plasma concentrations of ET-1 are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes complicated with atherosclerosis. ET-1 levels are also increased in subjects with diabetes and carotid atherosclerosis, and ET stimulates the production and release of inflammatory cytokines from monocytes. Elevated vascular ET-1 tissue levels promote endothelial dysfunction, and ET receptor blockade has been shown to inhibit the development of atherosclerotic lesions in animal models.
----
[RAS INHIBITION AND CARDIOVASCULAR PROTECTION]
Pharmacologic therapy that interrupts the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may afford special benefits in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with diabetes. ACE inhibitors, such as ramipril, and ARBs, such as losartan, have been shown to improve endothelial dysfunction and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPP) study demonstrated that patients with diabetes treated with captopril fared significantly better than those treated with conventional therapy in terms of primary endpoint and myocardial infarction.
----
[PATHOGENESIS OF MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
The pathogenesis of macrovascular complications in diabetes involves oxidative stress, mechanical stress, and hypoxia/ischemia, which activate the endothelin-urotensin systems, leading to atherosclerosis. This process is mediated by various factors, including angiotensin II, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cytokines. The activation of the endothelin system induces vasoconstriction, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and inflammation, contributing to the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

----
[ROLE OF UROTENSIN II IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS]
Urotensin II (UT II) plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, with its expression upregulated in endothelial, myointimal, and medial smooth muscle cells of atherosclerotic human coronary arteries. UT II has been shown to enhance atherosclerotic lesion formation by increasing ROS production and inflammatory cytokine expression. Treatment with a UT II receptor blocker has been associated with a reduction in intima lesion development.

----
[LINK BETWEEN UROTENSIN II AND INFLAMMATION]
Urotensin II is linked to the activation of the redox-sensitive enzyme NADPH oxidase in the vascular wall, leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory stimuli, including IL-1β and TNF-α, enhance UT receptor mRNA and protein expression, promoting monocyte recruitment and LDL cholesterol production.

----
[TNF-RELATED APOPTOSIS INDUCING LIGAND AND OSTEOPROTEGERIN]
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are involved in vascular pathophysiology, with TRAIL inducing apoptosis in transformed cell lines and tumor cells. OPG has been shown to interact with TRAIL and receptor activator of NF κB ligand (RANKL), and increasing evidence suggests that both TRAIL and OPG play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes-induced atherosclerosis.

----
[POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS]

----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
The mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway is involved in the initiation of complement activation in patients with diabetes, and high levels of MBL are associated with an increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and nephropathy have significantly higher circulating levels of MBL than those without nephropathy. MBL levels may have prognostic relevance in people with diabetes, and determination of MBL status might be useful to identify patients at increased risk of developing complications.

----
[COMPLEMENT SYSTEM ACTIVATION]
The mechanism responsible for the activation of the complement system in patients with diabetes is still unknown, but it has been hypothesized that hyperglycemia may activate the complement system via mitochondrial ROS production or enhanced RAGE activation.

----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL AND HYPERTENSION]
Optimal glucose control is pivotal for the prevention and treatment of microvascular complications, but its effects on macrovascular outcomes are less clear. Hypertension is also a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality, with epidemiologic studies showing that the risk starts at blood pressure values as low as 115/75 mmHg. The target systolic or diastolic blood pressure level has not been fully established, but studies suggest aiming for lower levels to reduce cardiovascular risk.

Endothelin-1 levels have been found to be influenced by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in patients with advanced atherosclerosis. The endothelin receptor has been cloned, and studies have shown that endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by vascular endothelial cells. Further research is needed to understand the role of endothelin in diabetes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

----
[CAROTID ATHEROSCLEROSIS IN DIABETES]
Carotid atherosclerosis is a significant concern in patients with type 2 diabetes. Studies have found that carotid atherosclerosis is more prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes, and that it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and diabetes, and to develop effective strategies for prevention and treatment.
----
[DIABETES AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS]
Research has shown that osteoprotegerin (OPG) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) play a role in the development of atherosclerosis, which is a common complication in diabetes. Studies have found that OPG and TRAIL levels are altered in atherosclerosis, and that OPG inactivation can accelerate advanced atherosclerotic lesion progression. Additionally, systemic delivery of TRAIL has been shown to have antiatherosclerotic activity in diabetic mice.

----
[OSTEOPROTEGERIN AND DIABETES]
Osteoprotegerin has been linked to both osteoporosis and arterial calcification, and studies have found that plasma concentrations of OPG are increased in type 2 diabetic patients with microvascular complications. This suggests that OPG may play a role in the development of vascular complications in diabetes.

----
[MANNAN-BINDING LECTIN AND DIABETES]
Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) has been associated with vascular complications in type 1 diabetes, and studies have found that increased levels of MBL are associated with incipient and overt nephropathy in type 1 diabetic patients. MBL has also been shown to be a predictor of microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Macrovascular complications in diabetes can be managed with various treatments, including atorvastatin, as shown in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS). The American Diabetes Association also provides guidelines for managing dyslipidemia in adults with diabetes. Additionally, research has shown that platelet function is impaired in patients with diabetes, making them more susceptible to thrombosis.

----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS]
Long-term fenofibrate therapy has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, according to the FIELD study. The PROactive Study also demonstrated that secondary prevention of macrovascular events can be achieved with pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes. Other studies, such as the RECORD trial, have evaluated the effects of rosiglitazone on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA IN DIABETES]
The management of dyslipidemia in adults with diabetes is crucial to prevent macrovascular complications. The American Diabetes Association recommends specific guidelines for managing dyslipidemia, including the use of statins such as simvastatin. Other studies have shown that intensive blood-pressure lowering and low-dose aspirin can also reduce the risk of macrovascular complications in patients with hypertension and diabetes.

----
[BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL IN DIABETES]
Tight blood pressure control is essential to reduce the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes, as demonstrated by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS 38). The HOT study also showed that intensive blood-pressure lowering and low-dose aspirin can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. Other studies have compared the effects of different antihypertensive agents, such as nisoldipine and enalapril, on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
----
[DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION]
Hypertension is up to twice as common in people with diabetes as in the general population, affecting 10-30% of people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 60-80% of those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Hypertension is associated with insulin resistance and other features of the metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance could raise blood pressure by loss of insulin's normal vasodilator activity or through effects of the accompanying hyperinsulinemia.

----
[SCREENING AND TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
All people with diabetes should be carefully screened for hypertension and evidence of hypertensive tissue damage at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter. Treatment is required for values that consistently exceed 130-140/80-85 mmHg, which is lower than the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension thresholds defined for hypertension in the general population. The blood lipid profile should also be checked.

----
[LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
The treatment of hypertension begins with lifestyle management, including reduced dietary fat and salt intakes, weight loss for obese patients, smoking cessation, and increased regular physical activity. These measures can lower blood pressure by up to 11/8 mmHg.

----
[ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS FOR DIABETES]
First-line antihypertensive drugs suitable for use in patients with diabetes are diuretics, cardioselective beta-blockers, calcium-channel antagonists (CCAs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs). Drugs can be selected for their beneficial effects on coexistent problems, such as angina or arrhythmia, heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, or nephropathy.

----
[COMBINATION THERAPY FOR HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
Over two-thirds of people with diabetes need combinations of two or more antihypertensive drugs to control hypertension. Effective combinations include beta-blocker plus CCAs, ACE inhibitor/ARB plus diuretic, and CCA plus ACE inhibitor/ARB.
----
[DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION ASSOCIATION]
Hypertension often accompanies diabetes mellitus, both type 1 and type 2, and their association has long been recognized. The relationship between diabetes and hypertension is complex, with both conditions being common and likely to be associated by chance, but also potentially having a common cause. Hypertension can develop as a consequence of diabetic nephropathy, and some drugs used to treat hypertension can induce diabetes in susceptible subjects.

----
[CAUSES OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
Essential hypertension accounts for about 10% of cases in people with diabetes, while other important causes include hypertension that coexists with insulin resistance, obesity, and impaired glucose tolerance in the metabolic syndrome. Hypertension secondary to diabetic nephropathy is also a significant cause. The metabolic syndrome consists of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, characteristic dyslipidemia, and other abnormalities that increase the risk of atherogenesis and macrovascular disease.

----
[PREVALENCE OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
Hypertension is up to twice as common in people with diabetes as in the general population, with 10-30% of subjects with type 1 diabetes and 60-80% of those with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes being hypertensive. There are racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of hypertension, with some populations being less frequently affected. Impaired glucose tolerance is also associated with hypertension, with 20-40% of cases being hypertensive.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT]
Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor that synergizes with the deleterious effects of diabetes, and it is also a risk factor for microvascular complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy. The management of hypertension in diabetes is crucial, with treatment targets and strategies still being debated. Lowering blood pressure has been shown to have benefits, but achieving this can be difficult in practice. The treatment target range for blood pressure in people with diabetes is generally lower than for the general population, at 130-140/80-85 mmHg.
----
[DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION ASSOCIATION]
Hypertension is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to insulin resistance syndrome, also known as metabolic syndrome. Additionally, hypertension is linked to nephropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Various factors, including diabetogenic antihypertensive drugs and endocrine disorders, can contribute to the development of hypertension in patients with diabetes.

----
[CAUSES OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
Certain medications, such as potassium-losing diuretics, beta-blockers, and glucocorticoids, can cause hypertension and glucose intolerance in patients with diabetes. Endocrine disorders like acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, and pheochromocytoma can also contribute to the development of hypertension and glucose intolerance.

----
[METABOLIC SYNDROME AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
The metabolic syndrome, which includes factors like central obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and dyslipidemia, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and syndrome X are all closely linked to the development of hypertension and atheroma formation.

----
[EARLY LIFE FACTORS AND HYPERTENSION]
Research suggests that physical inactivity, malnutrition, and early growth retardation may contribute to the development of hypertension and abnormal glucose homeostasis later in life. Family studies have shown a correlation between a mother's blood pressure and her offspring's blood pressure, which may be non-hereditary in origin.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND BLOOD PRESSURE]
Insulin resistance (IR) is closely associated with high blood pressure in both humans and animals. Experimental studies have shown that inducing IR can lead to an increase in blood pressure, and an inverse relationship has been demonstrated between blood pressure and insulin sensitivity in humans.
----
[INSULIN AND BLOOD PRESSURE]
Insulin may stimulate the sympathetic outflow, potentially increasing blood pressure, although direct evidence in humans is lacking. Additionally, insulin may stimulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to medial hypertrophy and increased peripheral resistance. This could contribute to the development of hypertension in individuals with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION ASSOCIATION]
There is a strong association between hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, particularly in young patients with type 1 diabetes. The presence of hypertension is closely related to renal damage and proteinuria, with blood pressure beginning to rise when urinary albumin excretion enters the microalbuminuric range. This association may be partly genetically determined.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HYPERTENSION]
Insulin resistance can contribute to the development of hypertension through various mechanisms, including impaired endothelium-mediated vasodilatation and increased peripheral resistance. Insulin can also raise blood pressure by retaining sodium ions and water in the distal renal tubule, and by stimulating the cell membrane Na+–K+ ATPase, which increases intracellular sodium concentrations and enhances contractility in vascular smooth muscle.

----
[MECHANISMS OF HYPERTENSION IN INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The mechanisms of hypertension in insulin resistance are complex and multifactorial, involving factors such as malnutrition in early life, lifestyle factors, genetic factors, and drugs and hormones. These factors can contribute to abnormal vascular development, increased peripheral vascular resistance, and hypertension, as illustrated in Figure 40.3.
----
[DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION]
The presence of diabetes can exacerbate the deleterious effects of hypertension on left ventricular function, including impaired left ventricular relaxation and increased left ventricular mass, which is an independent predictor of premature death from coronary heart disease (CHD). Hypertension also increases the risk of microvascular complications, such as nephropathy and end-stage renal failure, as well as retinopathy. Regular screening for hypertension is essential in people with diabetes.

----
[SCREENING FOR HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
People with diabetes should be regularly screened for hypertension, and hypertensive patients should be screened for diabetes, especially if they are obese or taking potentially diabetogenic drugs. All individuals with diabetes should have their blood pressure checked at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, with more frequent checks for those with other cardiovascular risk factors.

----
[MEASURING BLOOD PRESSURE IN DIABETES]
Blood pressure should be measured with the patient in a supine or sitting position, using an accurate sphygmomanometer and a cuff of appropriate size. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be recorded, and usual precautions should be taken to ensure reliability and avoid "white coat" stress effects. Conditions should be quiet and relaxed, and at least two readings should be taken initially and then repeated at intervals to determine the subject's typical values and any trend to change.

----
[POSTURAL BLOOD PRESSURE CHANGES IN DIABETES]
Blood pressure should also be checked with the patient in the upright position to detect potential postural hypotension, which can coexist with supine hypertension. A significant postural fall in blood pressure may indicate the need to change or reduce antihypertensive medication, especially if symptoms are provoked.

----
[BASIC MECHANISMS OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
The basic mechanisms of hypertension in diabetes include decreased sodium excretion with sodium and water retention, leading to increased peripheral resistance and raised intracellular sodium concentrations. The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) is uncertain, with both increased and decreased activity reported in different studies.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diagnostic tests for diabetes complications include echocardiography to reveal left ventricular dysfunction and decreased ejection fraction, exercise testing, and 24-hour Holter monitoring. Renal function tests, such as urine samples for microalbuminuria and microscopic examination for red and white blood cells, are also essential. Serum urea, creatinine, and electrolytes should be checked, and measurement of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may be considered if serum creatinine concentration is raised.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
The World Health Organization (WHO) and International Society of Hypertension (ISH) define hypertension as an office blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mmHg. However, in people with diabetes, the threshold is considered too high due to the additional risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease. Alternative target levels, such as aiming for a blood pressure of less than 130-140 mmHg systolic and below 80-85 mmHg diastolic, have been suggested by various expert bodies.

----
[INVESTIGATION OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
Initial investigation of hypertension in diabetes aims to exclude rare causes of secondary hypertension, assess tissue organ damage, and identify other treatable risk factors for vascular disease. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, medical history, and examination are essential to evaluate cardiac function and identify potential complications. The investigation should also include assessing renal function and identifying other risk factors for vascular disease.

----
[TREATMENT TARGETS FOR HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
Treatment targets for hypertension in diabetes have been suggested by various expert bodies, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and European Society of Hypertension (ESH). The targets generally recommend aiming for a blood pressure of less than 130-140 mmHg systolic and below 80-85 mmHg diastolic, with some organizations suggesting even lower targets for certain individuals with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Arterial atherosclerosis may affect up to 20% of older patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), potentially leading to severe and permanent renal impairment if angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are given. Lipid profile should be checked, and treatment for hyperlipidemia considered if total cholesterol or triglyceride levels are elevated. This is crucial in managing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes.

----
[MANAGING HYPERLIPIDEMIA IN DIABETES]
For patients with diabetes, treatment for hyperlipidemia should be considered if the total cholesterol is > 4.5 mmol/L, the LDL cholesterol level is > 2.5 mmol/L, or the LDL: HDL cholesterol ratio is > 4. Investigation of lipoprotein subclasses, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), LDL, HDL, and the apo-B: apo-A1 lipoprotein ratio, is recommended for further evaluation.

----
[INVESTIGATIONS FOR DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION]
Investigations for patients with diabetes and hypertension should include history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to assess cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, hyperlipidemia, and poor glycemic control. Electrocardiography, chest radiography, echocardiography, and blood tests, including urea, creatinine, electrolytes, and fasting lipids, should also be performed.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
The primary goal of treatment for hypertension in diabetes is strict blood pressure (BP) control, with a target mean office BP of less than 130-140/80-85 mmHg. Management begins with lifestyle modification, including weight reduction, sodium restriction, diet modification, and regular physical exercise, but most patients will require more than one antihypertensive drug to control BP adequately.

----
[NON-PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION]
Non-pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes should be based on structured lifestyle intervention, including weight reduction or stabilization, sodium restriction, diet modification, and regular physical exercise. Dietary intake of saturated fat should be reduced, and alcohol consumption restricted to 2-3 units/day in men and 2 units/day in women.
----
[DIABETES AND BETA-BLOCKERS]
Beta-blockers may significantly lower blood pressure levels in patients with diabetes and hypertension, although they can also aggravate hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. The hyperglycemic effect is attributed to inhibition of β2-adrenergic-mediated insulin release and decreased insulin action in peripheral tissues. The metabolic side effects of beta-blockers can be reduced by using low dosages combined with other agents or by intensifying non-pharmacologic efforts to decrease weight and improve physical activity.

----
[SIDE EFFECTS OF BETA-BLOCKERS IN DIABETES]
Beta-blockers may interfere with the counter-regulatory effects of catecholamines released during hypoglycemia, thereby blunting manifestations such as tachycardia and tremor and delaying recovery from hypoglycemia. They may also aggravate impotence and are generally contraindicated in second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) heart block, severe peripheral vascular disease, asthma, and chronic airway obstruction.

----
[USE OF BETA-BLOCKERS IN DIABETES PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE]
Certain beta-blockers, such as metoprolol and carvedilol, can be used favorably in cardiac failure in patients with diabetes. The Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in congestive heart failure (MERIT-HF) study showed that metoprolol can be used effectively in patients with diabetes and heart failure.

----
[COMPARISON OF BETA-BLOCKERS AND OTHER ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS]
Atenolol is a commonly used cardioselective beta-blocker that is effective as a single daily dose, although its stroke preventive effect is 16% less than other antihypertensive drugs. Metoprolol is an alternative, and both non-selective and selective beta-blockers are effective in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) after an initial event in patients with diabetes.

----
[DIURETICS IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
Diuretics are often effective antihypertensive agents for people with diabetes, as they help reduce the total body sodium load and extracellular fluid volume. However, diuretics that increase urinary potassium and magnesium losses can worsen hyperglycemia by impairing insulin secretion due to potassium depletion.
----
[ACE INHIBITORS IN DIABETES CARE]
ACE inhibitors are indicated in cardiac failure and are also suitable for use in people with diabetes, with established options including ramipril, enalapril, captopril, lisinopril, and perindopril. These medications can help prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with diabetes. However, they can cause side effects such as dry cough, potassium retention, and occasionally precipitate acute renal failure. Regular monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium levels is recommended, especially in patients with renal failure.

----
[ANGIOTENSIN II TYPE 1 RECEPTOR BLOCKERS IN DIABETES]
Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, such as losartan, irbesartan, valsartan, candesartan, and telmisartan, are metabolically neutral and effective antihypertensive drugs in people with diabetes. They do not cause cough and have been shown to slow the progression of nephropathy in patients with diabetes and varying degrees of albuminuria. These medications have also been shown to reduce cardiovascular endpoints and total mortality in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

----
[CALCIUM-CHANNEL ANTAGONISTS IN DIABETES]
Calcium-channel antagonists are useful vasodilator agents that do not generally worsen metabolic control in patients with diabetes when used at conventional dosages. However, sporadic cases of hyperglycemia have been reported after starting a calcium-channel antagonist, possibly due to inhibition of insulin secretion or compensatory sympathetic nervous activation. These medications have a slight negative inotropic effect and should be used with caution in patients with significant cardiac conditions.
----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY PROGRESSION]
Treating hypertension slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy by lowering blood pressure, which significantly decreases the rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary albumin excretion. This is evident from studies such as the one by Parving et al. Antihypertensive treatment is crucial in managing diabetic nephropathy. The goal is to slow the decline in GFR and prevent further kidney damage.

----
[ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS]
α1-Adrenoceptor antagonists, such as Doxazosin, can effectively lower blood pressure and improve dyslipidemia and insulin sensitivity. However, they may have side effects like nasal congestion and postural hypotension. Doxazosin is generally well-tolerated, especially in combination therapy. Other treatment options, like diuretics, may be more effective in preventing certain complications.

----
[TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR HYPERTENSION]
Lifestyle modification should be tried initially for 3 months or so. If moderate hypertension or signs of hypertensive tissue damage are present, drug therapy should be started immediately. Monotherapy with a first-line drug is recommended, taking into account other factors like coexisting conditions. The goal is to provide evidence-based and cost-effective treatment for each patient.

----
[HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
In patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), ACE inhibitors are particularly suitable if albuminuria or advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy are present. Alternative options like diuretics, β1-selective blockers, and calcium channel blockers (CCAs) are equally effective in reducing blood pressure. The choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and conditions.
----
[DIABETES AND RENAL FUNCTION]
In patients with moderately impaired renal function, thiazide diuretics become less effective, and furosemide or other loop diuretics should be used instead. However, in established end-stage renal failure, furosemide may be toxic, and dialysis must be started. Additionally, beta-blockers may mask hypoglycemia attacks in some patients.
----
[HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT IN T2DM]
Blood pressure control is generally more important than the choice of individual drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes. First-line agents include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, low-dose thiazide diuretics, and furosemide. Ramipril has evidence-based support for its use in patients with T2DM due to their high cardiovascular risk.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPY FOR HYPERTENSION]
Combination therapy is often needed to achieve satisfactory blood pressure control in patients with diabetes, especially those with type 2 diabetes. Using low-dose combinations of drugs can be more effective and have fewer side effects than increasing dosages of single agents. Certain combinations, such as ACE inhibitor plus diuretic, have proven to be safe and effective.
----
[SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN ETHNIC GROUPS]
Hypertension in diabetes is a serious medical problem in many ethnic groups, including African-Americans. In non-white European patients, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors may be less effective at lowering blood pressure, and diuretics and CCAs may be preferred. 
----
[OUTCOME OF TREATING HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
Effective treatment of hypertension can slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy and improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Tight blood pressure control has been shown to reduce the risk of microvascular complications, such as retinopathy and nephropathy, as well as stroke and heart failure.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
The ADVANCE Trial studied the effects of perindopril-indapamide on macrovascular and microvascular events in patients with diabetes, showing a reduced risk of major macrovascular events, including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. The trial also found a reduction in major microvascular events, such as new or worsening nephropathy or retinopathy. The results suggest that blood pressure management is crucial in preventing cardiovascular complications in diabetes.

----
[OPTIMAL BLOOD PRESSURE GOAL IN DIABETES]
The optimal blood pressure goal for patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is still not established, as evidenced by the ACCORD-Blood Pressure study, which found no significant difference in cardiovascular events between patients with a systolic blood pressure goal below 120 mmHg versus below 140 mmHg. However, a reduction in stroke was noticed in the intensive arm, suggesting that tighter blood pressure control may have some benefits.

----
[MULTIFACTORIAL APPROACH TO CARDIOVASCULAR PROTECTION]
A multifactorial approach is necessary to address and treat all major cardiovascular risk factors, not only blood pressure, to achieve lasting cardiovascular protection in patients with diabetes. This is supported by the Steno-2 trial, which demonstrated the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing cardiovascular risk factors in diabetes. By targeting multiple risk factors, healthcare providers can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Individuals with type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Studies have shown that insulin resistance, a common feature of type 2 diabetes, is a multifaceted syndrome responsible for various cardiovascular diseases. The Hypertension in Diabetes Study (HDS) and other research have highlighted the importance of managing hypertension in diabetic patients to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
Insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of cardiovascular disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Research has shown that insulin resistance syndrome predicts the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in healthy middle-aged men. The Helsinki Policemen Study, a 22-year follow-up study, found that insulin resistance syndrome was a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA AND BLOOD PRESSURE]
Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, can have a significant impact on blood pressure and cardiovascular health. Studies have shown that glucose tolerance and blood pressure are closely linked, and that individuals with impaired glucose tolerance are at increased risk of developing hypertension. The effects of glucose and insulin on renal electrolyte transport also play a crucial role in blood pressure regulation.

----
[MANAGING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN DIABETES]
Tight blood pressure control and management of cardiovascular risk factors are essential for reducing the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and other research have demonstrated the importance of intensive blood pressure lowering and lifestyle modifications in reducing cardiovascular risk.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Macrovascular complications in diabetes are a significant concern, with studies showing that cigarette smoking increases the risk of albuminuria among subjects with type 1 diabetes. Additionally, hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Various studies have investigated the effects of different antihypertensive treatments on cardiovascular disease risk in diabetic patients.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND SMOKING]
Insulin resistance and cigarette smoking have been linked in several studies, with one study published in the Lancet in 1992 finding a significant association between the two. This suggests that smoking may exacerbate insulin resistance, which is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.

----
[HYPERTENSION TREATMENT IN DIABETES]
The treatment of mild hypertension in patients with diabetes has been the subject of several studies, with some investigating the effects of nutritional-hygienic regimens and drug monotherapies. One study found that low-dose antihypertensive treatment with a thiazide diuretic was not diabetogenic, while another study compared the effects of hydrochlorothiazide and captopril on glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with hypertension.

----
[ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT AND DIABETES RISK]
Some studies have suggested that certain antihypertensive treatments may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while others have found that these treatments can have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease risk in diabetic patients. For example, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2000 found that diuretic-based antihypertensive treatment reduced cardiovascular disease risk in older diabetic patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

----
[BETA-BLOCKER TREATMENT IN DIABETES]
Beta-blocker treatment has been investigated in several studies as a potential therapy for patients with diabetes, with some finding that it can have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease risk. However, other studies have raised concerns about the potential for beta-blockers to mask hypoglycemic symptoms and worsen glucose tolerance.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Patients with diabetes are at high risk for vascular events, and managing cardiovascular risk factors is crucial in diabetes care. Studies such as the ONTARGET and ALLHAT trials have investigated the effects of various antihypertensive therapies on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. The use of certain antihypertensive medications, such as diuretics, can also affect glucose tolerance and insulin resistance.

----
[ANTIHYPERTENSIVE THERAPY IN DIABETES]
The choice of antihypertensive therapy in patients with diabetes is important, as some medications may have beneficial or adverse effects on glucose metabolism and cardiovascular outcomes. For example, the ADVANCE trial showed that a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide reduced macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Other studies, such as the ACCOMPLISH trial, have compared the effects of different antihypertensive regimens on hypertension in high-risk patients.

----
[ETHNICITY AND RESPONSE TO ANTIHYPERTENSIVE THERAPY]
Ethnicity can impact the response to antihypertensive therapy, with some populations, such as African Americans, being more prone to hypertension and diabetes. Studies have shown that African Americans with type 2 diabetes may require more aggressive blood pressure management to reduce cardiovascular risk. The impact of ethnicity on response to antihypertensive therapy should be considered when selecting treatment regimens for patients with diabetes.

----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY AND ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT]
Antihypertensive treatment can have a beneficial effect on kidney function in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group found that improved blood pressure control reduced the risk of cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Long-term follow-up studies have also shown that tight blood pressure control can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[GUIDELINES FOR DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
Various guidelines, such as the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, provide recommendations for the management of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. These guidelines emphasize the importance of blood pressure control, lipid management, and glucose control in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
The greatest long-term risk in diabetes is cardiovascular disease (CVD), with macrovascular disease being the cause of 80% of mortality in people with diabetes. Epidemiologic studies have established that glycemic control, nephropathy, and lipids are risk factors for CVD in type 1 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, smoking, and hypertension are the principal risk factors. 
----
[DIABETES LIPID THERAPIES]
The dyslipidemia of T2DM is associated with elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, and small dense particles. Reduction of LDL cholesterol with statins has consistently shown cardiovascular event reductions > 30%. Fibrates, when used as monotherapy, have shown a modest reduction in events in T2DM in the FIELD study. Optimal control of all risk factors can reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in diabetes by 50%.
----
[DIABETES AS A CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTOR]
The importance of diabetes as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor became established following the Framingham Study and was subsequently confirmed by other landmark studies. The magnitude of diabetes as a CVD risk factor is substantial, with the increase in cardiovascular risk being two- to fourfold. Many guidelines regard diabetes as a coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalent, based on a Finnish cohort that showed comparable risk of CHD outcomes between subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for > 10 years and subjects with established CHD.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
People with diabetes have a two- to fourfold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to the non-diabetic population. The risk of CVD is lowest when fasting blood glucose is between 4-4.9 mmol/L. Clinical judgment is necessary to assess risk accurately and select appropriate treatment, as risk calculators may predict risk with variable accuracy.
----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL AND CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES]
Improved glucose control may result in a larger cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) than in those with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, targeting near-normal glucose levels in T2DM has not shown a significant beneficial effect on CVD outcomes in some trials, such as the ACCORD and ADVANCE studies.
----
[MARKERS OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN DIABETES]
Other markers of CVD risk in people with diabetes include diabetic retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, microalbuminuria, and proteinuria. These markers can help clinicians assess the risk of CVD in patients with diabetes and select appropriate treatment.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF CLINICAL JUDGMENT]
Clinical judgment remains necessary to assess CVD risk accurately and select appropriate treatment, as all methods of CVD risk estimation suffer from distinct limitations. Clinicians may opt to estimate the risk by employing various risk calculators, such as the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk calculator, but should be aware of their limitations.
----
[STATIN THERAPY IN DIABETES]
Statin therapy has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. Studies such as the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) and the Heart Protection Study (HPS) have demonstrated a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol and combined cardiovascular endpoints. The CARDS trial showed a 40% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 37% reduction in cardiovascular endpoints, while the HPS showed a 33% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 31% reduction in cardiovascular endpoints.
----
[DIABETIC DYSIPLIDEMIA]
Diabetic dyslipidemia refers to the lipid abnormalities typically seen in persons with type 2 diabetes, characterized by elevated triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins. Enhanced glycation of lipoproteins has direct effects on lipoprotein metabolism, promoting atherogenesis and amplifying the effects of oxidative stress on lipoproteins. This condition is synonymous with atherogenic dyslipidemia and is a key factor in the excess cardiovascular disease risk seen in diabetes.
----
[LDL CHOLESTEROL REDUCTION IN DIABETES]
Reducing LDL cholesterol has been shown to be effective in preventing macrovascular complications in diabetes. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials of statins in 18,686 people with diabetes found a 9% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality and a 21% proportional reduction in major vascular events per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. However, the benefits of statin therapy seem to occur early in the disease, and aggressive LDL cholesterol reduction in end-stage diabetes with renal failure may not be as effective.
----
[CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING THERAPY IN DIABETES]
There is limited data on the use of cholesterol-lowering therapies other than statins in diabetes, as people with diabetes were often excluded from trials of these therapies. However, the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe has been shown to be effective in reducing LDL cholesterol, and other outcomes trials are underway to improve our understanding of the problem of glycemic control and cardiovascular disease in diabetes.
----
[TRIGLYCERIDES AND DIABETES]
Triglycerides are elevated in diabetes due to defects in insulin action and hyperglycemia, leading to changes in plasma lipoproteins. This elevation is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic events and is often found in uncontrolled diabetes. The mechanisms for hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes include increased production or absorption, or reduced catabolism, mainly due to decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL).

----
[CAUSES OF HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA]
The two main sources of plasma triglycerides are exogenous (from dietary fat) and endogenous (from the liver), carried in chylomicrons and VLDL particles, respectively. In diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes (T2DM), obesity and insulin-resistant metabolic disarray can lead to lipid abnormalities, including hypertriglyceridemia. The increased lipolysis in adipose tissue, a consequence of insulin resistance and/or insulin deficiency, results in increased fatty acid release from fat cells and increased fatty acid transport to the liver.

----
[TRIGLYCERIDES AS A CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTOR]
Elevated serum triglyceride levels are associated with an increased risk for atherosclerotic events, and several meta-analyses have found that triglycerides are an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, it is challenging to distinguish between cause and effect and to establish hypertriglyceridemia as an independent cardiovascular risk factor, as some causes of hypertriglyceridemia have no apparent effect on atherosclerotic vascular disease.

----
[MECHANISMS OF HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA IN DIABETES]
The mechanisms for hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes include increased production or absorption, or reduced catabolism, mainly due to decreased activity of LPL. Liver apolipoprotein B production is increased in T2DM, indirectly brought about by increased lipolysis in adipose tissue, a consequence of insulin resistance and/or insulin deficiency. This increased lipolysis results in increased fatty acid release from fat cells and increased fatty acid transport to the liver.
----
[DIABETES AND LIPID MANAGEMENT]
The management of lipid levels is crucial in diabetes care, as individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Fibrates, such as fenofibrate, have been shown to reduce total cardiovascular events, although their effect on all-cause mortality is unclear. Statins are the mainstay of lipid management, but their effects on triglycerides and HDL cholesterol are modest. 
----
[NIACIN THERAPY]
Niacin, or nicotinic acid, is a lipid-lowering agent that has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality when used in combination with other lipid-modifying drugs. It has a favorable effect on LDL cholesterol and is often referred to as a "broad-spectrum" lipid drug. Long-term clinical studies have demonstrated its benefits in reducing CHD events and mortality.
----
[CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION IN DIABETES]
Cholesterol absorption is adversely influenced in individuals with diabetes, with increased expression of certain proteins such as Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein. Additionally, the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABC-G5 and ABC-G8, which are involved in the efflux of dietary cholesterol, are reduced in diabetes. This altered cholesterol absorption may contribute to the development of atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetes.
----
[LIPID METABOLISM ENZYMES IN DIABETES]
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is an insulin-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have reduced LPL activity, which is further suppressed by adipose-derived cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). This reduced LPL activity may contribute to the development of dyslipidemia in diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND LIPID PROFILES]
In patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL cholesterol are common, and these conditions can be corrected with insulin therapy or other hypoglycemic agents. Certain medications, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, and acarbose, have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels in T2DM patients. Thiazolidinediones, like pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, also have effects on lipid profiles, although they can have different effects on LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. 
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, have different effects on lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk. Pioglitazone has been associated with a reduction in triglycerides and an increase in HDL cholesterol, while rosiglitazone has been linked to increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The PROACTIVE study found that pioglitazone reduced major atherosclerotic events in patients with T2DM, whereas the RECORD trial found no increased cardiovascular event rate with rosiglitazone.
----
[OTHER INTERVENTIONS FOR TRIGLYCERIDE REDUCTION]
Other interventions, such as orlistat, sibutramine, and rimonabant, have been shown to reduce triglycerides and improve lipid profiles in patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. These effects are often secondary to weight reduction. However, some of these medications have been suspended due to side effects or have shown limited benefits.
----
[HDL CHOLESTEROL AND ATHEROPROTECTION]
HDL cholesterol has been shown to have atheroprotective effects, and high levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Experimental studies have demonstrated that HDL has several beneficial effects on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health. However, the relationship between HDL cholesterol and cardiovascular risk is complex, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in diabetes care.
----
[DIABETES AND CHOLESTEROL GUIDELINES]
Guidelines for treating HDL cholesterol in diabetes patients vary, with some organizations suggesting no specific treatment target due to limited evidence. The American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association recommend lowering triglycerides to below 1.7 mmol/L and raising HDL to more than 1.15 mmol/L. In women, an HDL cholesterol goal of 0.3 mmol/L higher than this should be considered.
----
[EMERGING TREATMENTS FOR CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT]
New drugs that target cholesterol metabolism, such as Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein inhibitors and MTP inhibitors, may prove useful in managing cholesterol levels in diabetes patients. Additionally, interventions that regulate fatty acid synthesis, such as modulating stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 activity, may also be beneficial. HDL mimetic therapies and CETP inhibitors are also being investigated.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN DIABETES CARE]
Lifestyle intervention is crucial in preventing and treating diabetes and its associated dyslipidemia. Statins have revolutionized preventive cardiovascular medicine, and multifactorial intervention, including lifestyle changes and medication, can reduce cardiovascular events and mortality by 50% in diabetes patients.
----
[ROLE OF HDL IN ATHEROPROTECTION]
HDL cholesterol has distinct but potentially overlapping atheroprotective functions, including reverse cholesterol transport, reductions in oxidative stress, and innate immune inflammation. HDL-associated proteins play a fundamental role in innate immunity, and decreased HDL cholesterol levels in diabetes may be due to various factors, including CETP-mediated exchange of VLDL triglyceride for HDL cholesteryl esters.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and managing cardiovascular risk factors is crucial in diabetes care. The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) and other trials have shown that lipid-lowering therapies can reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. These therapies can help lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

----
[CARDIOVASCULAR RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES]
Intensive therapy, including lifestyle modifications and medications, can help reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. Studies have shown that intensive therapy can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, by up to 40-50%. Additionally, intensive therapy can also help reduce the risk of microvascular complications, such as retinopathy and chronic renal failure.

----
[PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Various pharmacologic treatments are available to help manage cardiovascular risk factors in patients with diabetes. These include metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, statins, fibrates, niacin, and orlistat, among others. Each of these treatments has a different effect on lipid profiles, blood pressure, and glucose control, and can help reduce cardiovascular risk to varying degrees.

----
[COMPARISON OF TREATMENT EFFECTS]
Table 40.5 summarizes the effects of different cardiovascular therapies on lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors, as well as their effects on diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk reduction. This information can help healthcare providers choose the most effective treatment options for their patients with diabetes.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Macrovascular complications in diabetes refer to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. The UKPDS risk engine is a model used to estimate the risk of coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetes. Several studies have shown that traditional risk equations, such as the Framingham and SCORE equations, may not provide reliable cardiovascular risk estimates in people with type 2 diabetes.

----
[CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ESTIMATION]
Cardiovascular risk estimation is crucial in diabetes care, and several studies have evaluated the accuracy of different risk equations. The DECODE study found that fasting glucose is sufficient to define diabetes, and the Framingham Offspring Study showed that metabolic risk factors worsen continuously across the spectrum of nondiabetic glucose tolerance. A meta-analysis of prospective studies found that nondiabetic hyperglycemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

----
[INTENSIVE DIABETES TREATMENT AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
Intensive diabetes treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The DCCT and UKPDS trials demonstrated that intensive glucose control can reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, and the ACCORD and ADVANCE trials found that intensive glucose lowering can reduce the risk of major vascular events. However, the optimal glycemic targets for cardiovascular risk reduction are still debated.

----
[DIABETIC DYSLIPIDEMIA]
Diabetic dyslipidemia, or abnormal lipid profiles, is a common feature of diabetes and contributes to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Advanced glycation end products and lipoprotein glycation can potentiate the stimulatory effect of glucose on macrophage lipoprotein lipase expression, leading to dyslipidemia. Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and increased small, dense LDL particles.

----
[REFERENCES AND STUDIES]
Several studies have investigated the relationship between diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including the Framingham study, the UKPDS, and the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study. These studies have provided valuable insights into the risk factors for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes and the benefits of intensive diabetes treatment and lipid-lowering therapy.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, with factors such as hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia playing a significant role. Research has shown that triglycerides are a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, with studies demonstrating a strong association between elevated triglyceride levels and increased risk of cardiovascular events. The metabolic syndrome, which is often associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, is also a key contributor to cardiovascular risk.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND LIPID METABOLISM]
Insulin resistance is closely linked to disordered lipid metabolism, with impaired insulin signaling leading to increased production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and reduced clearance of triglycerides. This can result in hypertriglyceridemia, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The interaction between free fatty acids and insulin also plays a critical role in the regulation of VLDL production, highlighting the complex relationship between insulin resistance and lipid metabolism.

----
[HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Hypertriglyceridemia is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with numerous studies demonstrating a strong association between elevated triglyceride levels and increased risk of coronary heart disease. The risk is particularly pronounced in individuals with familial forms of hypertriglyceridemia, who are at increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Elevated lipoprotein(a) levels also contribute to cardiovascular risk, particularly in middle-aged men.

----
[TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA]
The management of dyslipidemia in individuals with diabetes is critical for reducing cardiovascular risk. Various treatment options are available, including fibrates, statins, and other lipid-lowering therapies. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of these treatments in reducing cardiovascular events, with the Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial Study Group showing that gemfibrozil can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in men with low HDL cholesterol levels.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Macrovascular complications in diabetes can be prevented or managed with various medications, including niacin, statins, and extended-release niacin/laroprant. Clinical trials such as AIM-HIGH and others have investigated the effects of these medications on cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. The results of these trials can inform treatment decisions for patients with diabetes who are at risk of macrovascular complications.

----
[DIABETES TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Metformin monotherapy is a common treatment for type 2 diabetes, and its effectiveness has been evaluated in several studies, including a Cochrane systematic review. Other treatment options, such as sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones, have also been studied for their effects on plasma lipids, high-density lipoprotein composition, and cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[ORAL MEDICATIONS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
A systematic review of oral medications for type 2 diabetes has compared the effectiveness and safety of various medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. The review found that each medication has its own benefits and risks, and that the choice of medication should be individualized based on patient characteristics and needs.

----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, have been studied for their effects on cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. While these medications have been shown to improve glycemic control and lipid profiles, they have also been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure.

----
[OBESITY AND DIABETES PREVENTION]
Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and weight loss can improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of diabetes. Medications such as orlistat and sibutramine have been studied as adjuncts to lifestyle changes for weight loss and diabetes prevention in obese patients. These medications have been shown to be effective in promoting weight loss and improving metabolic parameters, but their use should be carefully considered in the context of overall patient health and risk factors.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
Patients with diabetes are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, and managing cardiovascular risk factors is crucial in diabetes care. Studies have shown that multifactorial interventions, including lipid modification and blood pressure control, can reduce cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. The role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in preventing and treating coronary heart disease is also an important area of research.

----
[LIPOPROTEIN METABOLISM AND DIABETES]
Lipid-altering agents and the management of lipoprotein metabolism are important in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Research has focused on the effects of various medications, such as torcetrapib and anacetrapib, on lipoproteins in patients with dyslipidemia. Understanding the role of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase in regulating lipid metabolism is also relevant to diabetes care.

----
[OBESITY AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and managing weight is an important aspect of diabetes care. Studies have investigated the effects of medications, such as rimonabant, on glycemic control, body weight, and lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. A multifactorial approach to managing obesity and diabetes is crucial for reducing cardiovascular risk and improving outcomes.

----
[RESEARCH AND GUIDELINES FOR DIABETES CARE]
Various studies and guidelines, such as those from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Cholesterol Education Program, provide recommendations for lipid modification and cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with diabetes. These guidelines emphasize the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors and provide evidence-based recommendations for diabetes care.
----
[DIABETES AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE LINK]
There is a strong link between congestive heart failure (CHF) and diabetes, with both conditions becoming increasingly more common. Diabetes is found in 12% of those with CHF, compared to only 3% of controls without CHF. A 1% reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has been found to reduce CHF by 16%. 
----
[PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND CHF]
The prevalence of the combination of CHF and diabetes is 0.5% in men and 0.4% in women, increasing with age. Diabetes is a serious prognostic factor for cardiovascular mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction caused by ischemic heart disease. 
----
[RISK FACTORS FOR CHF]
Risk factors for the development of CHF include increasing age, valvular heart disease, and ischemic heart disease (IHD), particularly previous myocardial infarction (MI). Diabetes should be added to this list as a strong risk factor. 
----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL AND CHF]
Poor glucose control contributes to the development of CHF, as reflected by the relation between an increase in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the risk of CHF. Available data favor a proportionately similar efficacy of evidence-based CHF therapy in patients with and without diabetes. 
----
[DIABETES TREATMENT AND CHF]
Thiazolidinediones can provoke or worsen CHF and should be used with great caution in patients with diabetes and heart failure. Further studies are needed before aggressive glucose normalization can be recommended as a possibility to improve the prognosis in patients with diabetes and CHF.
----
[DIABETES AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE RISK FACTORS]
The most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) include family history, smoking, abnormal blood lipids, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and socioeconomic factors. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and poor glucose control are also significant risk factors for CHF. Additionally, lipid perturbations, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and increased triglycerides contribute to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in T2DM.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS RISK FACTORS]
Risk factors for T2DM include family history, age, overweight or increased waist:hip ratio, and a sedentary lifestyle. The morbidity associated with T2DM increases progressively with the number of existing risk factors. Poor glucometabolic control, observed as high fasting plasma glucose and elevated HbA1c, also contributes to the risk of CAD and CHF.
----
[PREVALENCE OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND GLUCOSE ABNORMALITIES]
The prevalence of CHF varies in different studies, ranging from 0.6-6.2% in Swedish men, with an increase by age. The prevalence of CHF is similar in the overall population, with estimates ranging from 1-10% in a British outpatient population. The prevalence of CHF increases considerably in elderly populations, with a reported prevalence of 9.5% in the Italian Campania study.
----
[LINK BETWEEN CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND DIABETES]
There is a strong link between the existence of CHF and diabetes, with both conditions becoming increasingly more common. The links between these disorders are complex and not yet fully explored, with CHF predicting the appearance of diabetes in some studies.
----
[DIABETES AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE PREVALENCE]
The prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients with diabetes varies between 1.9 and 22.3%. Studies have found a strong association between diabetes and CHF, particularly in elderly populations. The incidence of CHF has been reported to be higher in men than in women, and it increases with age. 
----
[INCIDENCE OF CHF AND GLUCOSE ABNORMALITIES]
The incidence of CHF and glucose abnormalities has been studied in various populations, with results showing a decline in CHF incidence over the last five decades, but increasing hospital admissions for CHF. The age-standardized annual incidence of diabetes has been reported to be around 2.2-2.3 per 1000 person-years in European countries. 
----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETIC HEART DISEASE]
Myocardial structural and biochemical alterations can be identified in the failing heart, including changes in energy production, contractile proteins, and cytokine activity. These alterations are often independent of the etiology of myocardial dysfunction and are commonly found in diabetic hearts. 
----
[PREVALENCE OF UNDETECTED DIABETES]
It is estimated that at least 30% of patients with diabetes are undetected, and screening populations with known cardiovascular risk factors has revealed a significant prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. The prevalence of diabetes has been reported to be around 7-10% in various populations, with higher rates in selected high-risk groups, such as those with coronary artery disease.
----
[DIABETES AND HEART FAILURE ASSOCIATION]
There is a significant association between diabetes and congestive heart failure (CHF), with studies showing that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing CHF. The odds ratio for CHF in people with diabetes is 2.0, with a confidence interval of 1.6-2.5. Additionally, the incidence of CHF is higher in people with diabetes, with a rate of 12.6/100 person-years compared to 1.5/100 person-years in controls.
----
[DIABETES PREVALENCE IN CHF PATIENTS]
The prevalence of diabetes in patients with CHF is significant, with one study showing a prevalence of 14.7% in people with type 2 diabetes. Another study found that 22.3% of patients with CHF had diabetes. The prevalence of CHF in people with diabetes is also notable, with one study showing a prevalence of 9.5%.
----
[DIABETES AS A PREDICTIVE FACTOR FOR CHF]
Diabetes is a predictive factor for CHF, with a study showing that the risk of CHF increases by 8% for every 1% (11 mmol/mol) increase in HbA1c. Other predictive factors for CHF in people with diabetes include BMI, waist:hip ratio, age, female sex, diabetes duration, insulin use, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.
----
[DIABETES AND CHF MORTALITY]
The mortality rate is higher in people with diabetes and CHF, with a relative rate of 1.5 compared to those without diabetes. This highlights the importance of managing diabetes and CHF simultaneously to reduce the risk of mortality.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
When the heart is subjected to ischemic stress or increased intraventricular pressure, it tends to change towards a more dominant glucose oxidation, which may be counteracted by a reduction of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4). This reduction can hamper glucose transport over the cell membrane, leading to myocardial dysfunction. Prolonged intracellular accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their metabolites may also contribute to myocardial dysfunction.

----
[METABOLIC DISTURBANCES IN HEART FAILURE]
Alterations in gene expression and inflammatory activity have been suggested to cause metabolic and mechanical disturbances in congestive heart failure (CHF). The heart, including cardiomyocytes, can produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), in response to injury, which can trigger a cascade of events leading to myocardial structural alterations and further deteriorating the clinical picture of CHF.

----
[ENERGY PRODUCTION IN THE MYOCARDIUM]
The dominant pathway for myocardial energy production is β-oxidation of free fatty acids (FFA), but the myocardium is also dependent on glucose oxidation. The heart can switch between these two energy sources, with glucose oxidation becoming more dominant under certain conditions, such as ischemic stress or increased intraventricular pressure.

----
[NEUROHORMONAL ACTIVATION IN HEART FAILURE]
Neurohormonal activation, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic activity, and arginine vasopressin, can lead to a vicious circle further compromising the already compromised myocardial function in heart failure. This activation can result in vasoconstriction, salt and water retention, and increased cardiac lesion impedance.
----
[DIABETES AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE]
People with diabetes are at increased risk for congestive heart failure (CHF) and other disturbances, such as reduced myocardial blood flow and blunted hyperkinetic response to myocardial ischemia, resulting in diminished myocardial function. CHF is an insulin-resistant state with increased release of non-esterified fatty acids, which downregulate glucose uptake and utilization. This leads to a shift towards beta-oxidation of fatty acids for energy production, rather than glucose oxidation. As a result, glucose utilization for energy production is substantially lower in individuals with diabetes.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND ENERGY PRODUCTION]
In the diabetic heart, glucose utilization for energy production is substantially lower, about 10%, due to the slow rate of glucose transport across the sarcolemmal membrane in the myocardium. The impaired glucose oxidation in the diabetic heart can also result from a decreased rate of phosphorylation. As a result, the heart relies more heavily on beta-oxidation of fatty acids for energy production, which requires more oxygen and can lead to increased oxidative stress.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA AND OXIDATIVE STRESS]
Hyperglycemia can lead to oxidative stress and activation of processes triggered by increased levels of diacylglycerol and protein kinase C. This can result in a range of unfavorable effects, including basement thickening, membrane hyperpermeability, cell growth, and angiogenesis, ultimately contributing to cardiomyopathy and impaired blood flow. The increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in heart failure patients may also enhance insulin resistance.

----
[DIABETIC HEART ENERGY METABOLISM]
The main myocardial energy production in individuals with diabetes is based on beta-oxidation of fatty acids (about 60-70%), with a smaller contribution from glucose oxidation (about 30%). However, in conditions with limited oxygen availability, glucose oxidation can provide more energy per mole oxygen and support more work than fatty acid oxidation. In the diabetic heart, the shift towards beta-oxidation of fatty acids can lead to increased oxygen utilization and oxidative stress.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
The DECODE study found that a 2-hour post-load glucose was a better predictor of mortality than fasting blood glucose, highlighting the importance of post-prandial hyperglycemia and its potential implications for myocardial function. This suggests that managing blood glucose levels after meals is crucial for reducing cardiovascular risk in individuals with diabetes. The study's findings also underscore the need for careful monitoring and management of glucose levels in people with diabetes.

----
[HEART FAILURE TREATMENT]
Evidence-based treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients with diabetes typically involves a combination of medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone antagonists. These medications can help reduce mortality and improve symptoms in patients with moderate to severe CHF. However, treatment outcomes can vary, and some patients may still experience poor prognosis despite optimal pharmacologic treatment.

----
[NOVEL TREATMENT APPROACHES]
Researchers are exploring novel treatment modalities for CHF, particularly in patients with diabetes. One approach involves metabolic modulation with compounds that influence disturbed metabolic pathways in CHF. Examples of such drugs include trimetazidine, ranolazine, etomoxir, and dichloroacetate, which aim to shift energy production from fatty acid oxidation to more efficient glucose oxidation.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES]
Various techniques are used to study the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in CHF, including questionnaires to assess overall well-being, exercise tolerance tests, and two-dimensional echocardiography to investigate myocardial function. A relatively new technique, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), can assess myocardial function in different segments and diagnose left ventricular dysfunction even before symptoms or signs of CHF appear in patients with diabetes.

----
[GUIDELINES AND MANAGEMENT]
Recently published guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) provide a framework for managing diabetes, pre-diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), including CHF. However, there is a lack of specific evidence regarding the management of patients with both glucose abnormalities and CHF, highlighting the need for further research and subgroup analyses.

----
[PROGNOSIS AND MORTALITY]
The prognosis for patients with CHF is generally poor, with mortality rates ranging from 10-20% per year in patients with mild to moderate symptoms and 40-60% per year in those with severe symptoms. The presence of diabetes can further worsen the prognosis, with studies showing that mortality rates are substantially higher in patients with diabetes and CHF compared to those without diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE TREATMENT]
The use of beta-blockers is indicated as first-line treatment in patients with the combination of congestive heart failure (CHF) and diabetes, as they reduce mortality and improve symptoms. Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease myocardial FFA exposure, which can favorably influence the metabolic pathway in patients with type 2 diabetes and CHF. Subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes and moderate to severe CHF participating in large trials reveal that beta-blockers reduce mortality and improve symptoms.
----
[ACE INHIBITION IN DIABETES AND CHF]
ACE inhibitors are recommended both in asymptomatic myocardial dysfunction and overt CHF, and have been shown to reduce mortality and improve symptoms in moderate to severe CHF with and without diabetes. Patients with diabetes represent large subgroups in several trials, and the effect of ACE inhibitors on compromised left ventricular function has been similar in patients with and without diabetes. However, hypoglycemic episodes may be provoked by ACE inhibitor therapy in patients on glucose-lowering therapy, and plasma glucose should be monitored in the early phase of ACE inhibitor institution.
----
[DIURETICS AND ALDOSTERONE ANTAGONISTS IN DIABETES AND CHF]
Diuretics are mandatory for symptomatic relief of fluid overload in CHF patients, but should not be used in excess as they can induce neurohormonal activation. Loop diuretics are recommended rather than diuretics that may further impair glucose metabolism. The addition of aldosterone antagonists is indicated in severe forms of CHF and may improve longevity, but there is limited information on their administration in patients with diabetes and CHF.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF TREATMENT IN DIABETES AND CHF]
The absolute prognosis is considerably worse in patients with diabetes and CHF, making the impact of therapy expressed as the number of patients needed to treat to avoid an event (e.g. hospitalization for CHF or death) considerably lower among these patients than their counterparts without diabetes. Available data favor a proportionately similar efficacy in patients with and without diabetes, but the relative risk reduction following treatment is similar in both groups, with a substantially higher remaining event rate in the diabetic cohort.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetes-related cardiovascular involvement can cause decreased myocardial blood flow reserve, and hyperglycemia-related early myocardial and microcirculatory disturbances may be reversed by improved metabolic control. Impaired myocardial diastolic function and endothelial dysfunction are early expressions of diabetes-related cardiovascular involvement. Intensified glucose control, particularly insulin-based glycemic control, may be useful in reversing these disturbances.

----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL AND DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION]
The relationship between glycemic control and myocardial diastolic dysfunction is still being studied, and it is too early to abandon the hypothesis of a favorable relation between the two. The Diabetes mellitus And Diastolic Dysfunction (DADD) trial did not verify the assumption that insulin-based glycemic control may be useful, but it may be that the patients were too healthy to react to normalization of glucose control.

----
[METABOLIC MODULATORS FOR DIABETES]
Drugs such as trimetazidine, etomoxir, and dichloroacetate, which shift myocardial metabolism from oxidation of FFA towards glycolysis, have been tested in patients with myocardial dysfunction and diabetes. Their usefulness must be further explored in clinical trials of appropriate design until their therapeutic role can be considered established.

----
[STATIN THERAPY FOR CHF]
Statin treatment may not impact morbidity and longevity in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), as two recent clinical trials, the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Study in Heart Failure (CORONA) and GISSI Heart Failure (GISSI-HF), were both negative in this respect. Statin therapy is not indicated as part of the management of CHF unless needed for other reasons.

----
[GLUCOSE LOWERING TREATMENT FOR CHF]
Meticulous metabolic control may have beneficial effects on progress and prognosis in patients with diabetes and CHF. The European guidelines for the management of diabetes recommend an HbA1c target of <6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND HEART FAILURE RISK]
People with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing heart failure, with studies such as the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Reykjavik Study highlighting the association between glucose abnormalities and heart failure. The risk of heart failure is also linked to other factors such as obesity, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Diabetes care should therefore include monitoring and management of these risk factors to prevent heart failure.

----
[HEART FAILURE PREVALENCE IN DIABETES]
The prevalence of heart failure in people with diabetes is significant, with studies such as the Rotterdam Study and the Framingham Study reporting a high incidence of heart failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Understanding the prevalence of heart failure in diabetes is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLUCOSE CONTROL]
Glucose control is essential in preventing heart failure in people with diabetes, as highlighted by studies such as the UKPDS. The association between glycaemia and macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes emphasizes the need for tight glucose control to reduce the risk of heart failure.

----
[PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Prevention of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes, such as those demonstrated in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, can also reduce the risk of heart failure. Lifestyle interventions, including diet and exercise, can help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes and subsequently reduce the risk of heart failure.

----
[DIABETES SCREENING AND EARLY INTERVENTION]
Early screening and intervention for diabetes, as demonstrated by the Belgian type 2 diabetes screening program, can help identify individuals at risk of heart failure and enable timely intervention to prevent or delay the onset of heart failure.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Macrovascular complications in diabetes are associated with increased vascular superoxide production, which is linked to the role of NAD(P)H oxidase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Metabolic dysfunction in the diabetic heart is also a significant factor, with alterations in cardiac metabolism contributing to the development of heart failure. The diabetic heart exhibits changes in energy metabolism, including reduced fatty acid oxidation and increased glucose metabolism.

----
[DIABETIC CARDIOMYOPATHY]
Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a metabolic disorder characterized by disturbances in glucose and fatty acid metabolism, leading to cardiac dysfunction. The glucose-fatty acid cycle plays a crucial role in insulin sensitivity and metabolic disturbances in diabetes mellitus. Pretranslational suppression of an insulin-responsive glucose transporter is also observed in rats with diabetes mellitus, contributing to the development of cardiomyopathy.

----
[ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Endothelial dysfunction is a key feature of diabetes, with acute hyperglycemia attenuating endothelium-dependent vasodilation in humans. Reduced myocardial flow reserve is also observed in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, contributing to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Angiographic findings and outcomes in diabetic patients treated with thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction are also affected by endothelial dysfunction.

----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
Diabetes is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with the Framingham study demonstrating a strong association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance is also a key factor in chronic heart failure, with a relation to the severity and etiology of heart failure. The metabolic approaches to the treatment of ischemic heart disease are being explored, with a focus on improving insulin sensitivity and reducing metabolic disturbances.
----
[DIABETES AND HEART FAILURE]
Patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of developing congestive heart failure, with macrovascular and microvascular complications.

----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Macrovascular complications in diabetes are associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and mortality. Studies have shown that ACE inhibitors, such as candesartan, can reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure. Additionally, beta-blockers, such as metoprolol and carvedilol, have been shown to be effective in reducing mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure.

----
[DIABETES AND HEART FAILURE]
Patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing heart failure, and the presence of diabetes can affect the outcome of heart failure treatment. Studies have shown that diabetes can alter myocardial fatty acid and glucose metabolism, leading to a worse prognosis. However, the use of certain medications, such as beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, can improve outcomes in patients with diabetes and heart failure.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES AND HEART FAILURE]
The management of diabetes and heart failure requires a comprehensive approach, including the use of medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and statins. Studies have shown that tight glycemic control can reduce the risk of macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes. Additionally, the use of certain medications, such as spironolactone and rosuvastatin, can improve outcomes in patients with severe heart failure.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Glycemic control is crucial in reducing the risk of macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes. Studies have shown that tight glycemic control can reduce the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and mortality. Meta-analyses of randomized trials have confirmed the importance of glycemic control in reducing the risk of macrovascular disease in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND HEART FAILURE]
The relationship between diabetes and heart failure is complex, with several studies investigating the effects of glucose control on cardiovascular outcomes. Research has shown that intensive glycemic control can help prevent cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, insulin therapy has been found to improve endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease.

----
[GLUCOSE CONTROL AND CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS]
Studies such as the ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VA Diabetes Trials have demonstrated the importance of intensive glucose control in preventing cardiovascular events. The American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation have issued position statements and scientific statements highlighting the implications of these trials. These statements emphasize the need for careful consideration of the benefits and risks of intensive glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY AND CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES]
Insulin therapy has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. For example, a study published in the journal Diabetes found that insulin therapy improved insulin-stimulated endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease. Another study published in the journal Heart found that augmented metabolic control improved myocardial diastolic function and perfusion in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

----
[METABOLIC MODULATORS AND CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES]
Metabolic modulators such as trimetazidine have been found to have cardiac and extracardiac benefits in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. A study published in the journal Circulation found that trimetazidine improved left ventricular function in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure. Another study published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology found that trimetazidine had beneficial effects on left ventricular function in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure.

----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES AND CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES]
Thiazolidinediones, a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, have been found to have both beneficial and adverse effects on cardiovascular outcomes. A meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that pioglitazone was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, while another study published in JAMA found that rosiglitazone was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, a study published in the Lancet found that pioglitazone had beneficial effects on macrovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AS A RISK FACTOR FOR STROKE]
Diabetes is a strong and independent risk factor for ischemic cerebrovascular disease, with a relative risk of around two. The risk of stroke is higher in patients with diabetes, and they are also more likely to have worse outcomes, including a higher rate of mortality. Additionally, diabetes predisposes individuals to vascular events, including stroke, due to premature atherosclerosis, reduced response to nitric oxide, and a general state of hypercoagulability.

----
[STROKE OUTCOMES IN DIABETES]
Ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes has worse outcomes, including a higher rate of mortality, compared to those without diabetes. While transient ischemic attacks (TIA) may occur less frequently in individuals with diabetes, they are more likely to progress to a completed stroke in the immediate period following. Aggressive management of hyperglycemia in the acute stroke period may improve outcomes.

----
[PREVENTION OF STROKE IN DIABETES]
Prevention of stroke in patients with diabetes is best accomplished through aggressive management of coexisting hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as lifestyle modification. Reduction of glycated hemoglobin, as a proxy for good glycemic control, is likely to be associated with a reduction of macrovascular events, including stroke.

----
[EPIDEMIOLOGY OF STROKE]
Cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with approximately 700,000 strokes occurring each year in the USA. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the USA, and the cost of stroke to the healthcare system is significant, with an estimated $62.7 billion in 2007. Similar statistics are seen in other countries, with the Oxford Vascular Study and the WHO MONICA study demonstrating a high incidence of stroke worldwide.

----
[DIABETES AND STROKE RISK IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS]
The risk of stroke associated with diabetes is stronger in ethnic minorities in the USA, with a higher odds ratio for ischemic stroke in African-Americans and Caribbean Latinos compared to Caucasians. Observational studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study and the Honolulu Heart Study, have demonstrated associations between diabetes and ischemic cerebrovascular disease in different populations.
----
[DIABETES AND STROKE RISK]
Diabetes increases the risk of death from stroke, with a relative risk of 6 for mortality from ischemic stroke in men and 8.2 in women. Additionally, diabetes is more likely to be associated with lacunar infarcts, which are small deep infarcts in the territory of a single penetrating arterial branch. The fraction of stroke deaths directly attributable to diabetes were 16% in men and 33.3% in women.

----
[DIABETES AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE]
Diabetes is associated with both extracranial and intracranial stenosis, and exacerbates the effects of other risk factors, such as isolated systolic hypertension, to increase the risk of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In patients with diabetes, ischemic stroke occurs at a younger age and is more likely to be associated with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of myocardial infarction.

----
[STROKE SUBTYPES AND DIABETES]
Lacunar infarcts are the most common stroke subtype associated with diabetes, and are characterized by small deep infarcts in the territory of a single penetrating arterial branch. Diabetes is also associated with an increased prevalence of microvascular disease, and lacunar disease is more likely to be associated with diabetes than hemorrhages in the same location.

----
[RISK FACTORS FOR STROKE IN DIABETES]
The risk factors for stroke in patients with diabetes include hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and carotid artery disease. Diabetes confers additional risk of ischemic stroke or TIA in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, and increases the relative risk of first stroke, incident stroke, and hospital admission for stroke.
----
[DIABETES AND STROKE RISK]
Diabetes is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), and thus for myocardial infarction (MI) and subsequent development of atrial fibrillation, which in turn increases the risk of cardioembolic stroke. The CHADS2 score is a validated method of stratifying risk of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, and diabetes is one of the factors that increases the risk. Diabetes alone increases the risk of stroke in a patient with atrial fibrillation from 1.9 to 2.8. The CHADS2 score assigns one point for the presence of diabetes, among other factors.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOEMBOLIC STROKE]
Atrial fibrillation has been repeatedly demonstrated to be a strong risk factor for cardioembolic stroke, with an estimated 75,000 strokes per year attributable to the arrhythmia. Diabetes increases the risk of cardiac embolization, and the CHADS2 score is a useful tool for guiding the use of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. The score is not perfect, but it is easy to use and helps identify patients at high risk of stroke.
----
[DIABETES AND HEMORRHAGIC STROKE]
In large observational studies, there has not appeared to be an association between diabetes and hemorrhagic strokes. However, in the Hemorrhagic Stroke Project, a case-control study of young patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, diabetes conferred an adjusted odds ratio of 2.4, although hypertension was a more significant risk factor. The relationship between diabetes and hemorrhagic stroke is not as clear as the relationship between diabetes and ischemic stroke.
----
[INTERMEDIATE HYPERGLYCEMIA AND STROKE RISK]
Intermediate hyperglycemia, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, may also be a risk factor for stroke, although the evidence is not as strong as it is for diabetes. Studies have shown that increasing tertiles of HbA1c are associated with an increased risk of stroke, although the difference only achieved statistical significance in patients with diabetes. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between intermediate hyperglycemia and stroke risk.
----
[DIABETES AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE]
Diabetes is associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), a marker of atherosclerosis, which is a risk factor for stroke. Studies have shown that patients with diabetes and stroke have greater cIMT compared to those without stroke. Additionally, diabetes affects the ability of blood vessels to release nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, which can lead to vasoconstriction and poor response to ischemia.

----
[ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
The diabetic blood vessel has reduced NO production or altered NO metabolism, which can lead to decreased vasodilation and increased platelet aggregation. This endothelial dysfunction can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and increase the risk of stroke. Decreased NO activity has been observed in stroke patients, particularly in those with larger strokes.

----
[ROLE OF STATINS IN STROKE PREVENTION]
Statins, or 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been shown to have beneficial effects beyond lowering plasma cholesterol, including increasing expression of endothelial NO synthase and decreasing the activity of Rho-kinase, a proconstrictor enzyme. Statins have been demonstrated to lower the risk of recurrent stroke in multiple large studies.

----
[HYPERCOAGULABILITY IN DIABETES]
The blood of patients with diabetes is hypercoagulable, with increased thrombin generation, prothrombin fragments, and thrombin-antithrombin III complexes. This hypercoagulable state may contribute to the increased risk of stroke in patients with diabetes.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND STROKE RISK]
Insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes, has been shown to have a mild increase in risk of stroke, although the evidence is conflicting. The relationship between insulin resistance and stroke risk is complex and may be influenced by other factors, such as hyperglycemia and atherosclerosis.
----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
The use of rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, has been linked with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and death from cardiovascular causes, while pioglitazone, another medication in the same class, was not associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes and reduced the risk of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke by 16%. Glycemic control has not been directly linked to a reduction in risk for stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
----
[IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING VASCULAR RISK FACTORS]
In treating hypertension in people with diabetes, medications that affect the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), appear to have the greatest benefit. These medications have been shown to reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular causes and stroke, even when blood pressure reduction is minimal.
----
[TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
The Hypertensive Old People in Edinburgh (HOPE) trial and the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) trial demonstrated the benefits of using ACEi and ARB in patients with diabetes and hypertension, with significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality, MI, and stroke. These benefits were observed even when blood pressure reduction was not substantial, suggesting that these medications have additional protective effects beyond blood pressure lowering.
----
[PLATELET HYPERREACTIVITY IN DIABETES]
In patients with diabetes, platelet hyperreactivity contributes to thrombus formation and increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Studies have shown that platelets in patients with diabetes have increased activity, including increased fibrinogen binding and expression of activated ligands on the platelet surface, which can be measured by platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) and light transmittance aggregometry.
----
[DIABETES AND STROKE TREATMENT]
Thrombolysis in patients with diabetes and acute stroke is not as successful as in the general population, with one series showing no recanalization of the occluded artery in patients with diabetes treated with intravenous t-PA. Additionally, patients with diabetes may be less likely to achieve major neurologic improvement with intravenous t-PA treatment. Intra-arterial thrombolysis has shown promise, but diabetes is associated with poor functional outcome at 3 months. 
----
[INTENSIVE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR DIABETES]
A recent trial of intensive multifactorial medical management in patients with diabetes with microalbuminuria showed a reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events, including a decrease in stroke incidence. The regimen aimed to achieve tight control of HbA1c, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. 
----
[ANTIPLATELET TREATMENT FOR DIABETES]
Antiplatelet treatment, such as aspirin, is recommended for primary prevention of CAD, but its effectiveness in preventing ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes is unclear, with one meta-analysis showing only a 7% reduction in serious vascular events. However, the potential benefits of prophylactic aspirin may outweigh the risks in high-risk populations. 
----
[GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ANTITHROMBOTIC MEDICATION]
Most early trials of antithrombotic medications were performed only on men, but the Women's Health Study found that low-dose aspirin was associated with a 17% risk reduction in stroke, including a 24% risk reduction in ischemic stroke, in female health professionals with no history of coronary or cerebrovascular disease.
----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA AND STROKE OUTCOMES]
Hyperglycemia at the time of stroke treatment is associated with worsened outcomes, including increased mortality and poor functional recovery. Persistent hyperglycemia, rather than stress response hyperglycemia, may be the primary cause of damage in the acute stroke setting. Intensive treatment of hyperglycemia may be associated with improved outcomes, as demonstrated in some studies.
----
[GLUCOSE LEVELS AND TREATMENT]
Current guidelines recommend starting aggressive glycemic control if serum glucose is > 200 mg/dL, while acknowledging that levels > 140-185 mg/dL may still be harmful. Hyperglycemia, as defined by serum glucose > 400 mg/dL, is a contraindication for inclusion in some clinical trials due to its potential to cause focal neurologic deficits that mimic stroke.
----
[ORAL HYPOGLYCEMICS IN ACUTE STROKE]
Sulfonylureas, a type of oral hypoglycemic, may have a neuroprotective effect during ischemia due to their impact on ATP-sensitive potassium channels. One study found that patients taking sulfonylureas before and during acute hospitalization were more likely to have a decrease in stroke severity and achieve excellent functional recovery at discharge.
----
[STROKE CARE AND MANAGEMENT]
Further care for the acute stroke patient is best handled in a certified stroke unit with multidisciplinary care from a team consisting of vascular neurologists, stroke-trained registered nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. This approach can help improve outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.
----
[DIABETES AND STROKE RISK]
Patients with diabetes who have had a stroke are considered high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and should have their levels lowered to < 100 mg/dL, with < 70 mg/dL being ideal. These patients should also be started on a statin. Antiplatelet therapy should be initiated in all patients who have had a non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. 
----
[ANTIPLETLET THERAPY IN DIABETES]
Antiplatelet therapy, such as clopidogrel, has been shown to decrease the rate of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death in patients with diabetes. A post hoc analysis of the CAPRIE study found that people with diabetes treated with clopidogrel had a decreased rate of stroke, MI, or death of 15.6% compared to 17.7% in those treated with aspirin.
----
[CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE MANAGEMENT IN DIABETES]
In patients with diabetes who have had ischemic stroke secondary to extracranial carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is the preferred treatment for carotid artery stenosis greater than 70%. Carotid artery stenting is still being studied and is typically reserved for high-risk situations, such as significant cardiac disease or previous radical neck surgery.
----
[ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY IN DIABETES]
Patients with diabetes and atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated with warfarin to a goal International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0, which can reduce the risk of stroke by 68%. This reduction in risk is significant, and the benefits of anticoagulation outweigh the risks of bleeding.
----
[BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL IN DIABETES AND STROKE]
Blood pressure control in acute ischemic stroke is a subject of ongoing debate, but current thinking supports permissive hypertension in the peri-stroke period, allowing blood pressure to remain untreated until systolic BP rises > 220 mmHg or diastolic BP > 120 mmHg. The period over which permissive hypertension should be allowed is typically 3-5 days after stroke.
----
[PREVENTION OF MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS AFTER STROKE IN DIABETES]
Prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and aspiration pneumonitis is crucial in patients with diabetes who have had a stroke. Subcutaneous anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin, with or without external compressive devices, can help prevent DVT. Initiation of treatment is typically immediate upon admission, regardless of the size of infarct.
----
[DIABETES AND STROKE RISK]
Diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for stroke, with studies showing that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing stroke and having a poorer outcome after a stroke. The risk of stroke in people with diabetes is attributed to various factors, including atherosclerotic disease, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. According to several studies, diabetes is an independent risk factor for ischemic heart disease, stroke, and death.

----
[STROKE INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY]
Research has shown that the incidence and mortality rates of stroke vary among different populations, with diabetes being a significant contributing factor. Studies such as the Oxford Vascular Study and the WHO MONICA project have reported on the incidence, case fatality, and mortality rates of stroke in different regions, highlighting the importance of considering diabetes as a risk factor. The probability of stroke can be estimated using risk profiles, such as the one developed from the Framingham Study.

----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
Diabetes is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including atrial fibrillation and flutter, in addition to other cardiovascular conditions. The presence of diabetes can increase the risk of stroke, heart disease, and death, making it essential to manage diabetes effectively to reduce the risk of these complications. Studies have consistently shown that diabetes is a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease, highlighting the need for aggressive management of risk factors.

[STROKE PREVENTION GUIDELINES]
Guidelines for the prevention of stroke in people with diabetes emphasize the importance of managing risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and atherosclerotic disease. The American Heart Association and other organizations have developed guidelines for the prevention of stroke, which include recommendations for lifestyle modifications, medication, and other interventions to reduce the risk of stroke in people with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE]
Patients with type 2 diabetes have been found to have a blunted response to systemic nitric oxide synthase inhibition in the cerebral circulation, which may contribute to an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, studies have shown that intensive diabetes treatment can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The importance of hypercoagulability over hyperglycemia for vascular complications in type 2 diabetes has also been highlighted.

----
[PLATELET FUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome have been found to exhibit higher platelet activity than those with conventional risk factors for vascular disease. This increased platelet activity may contribute to the development of vascular complications in diabetes. Furthermore, studies have shown that patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease on combined aspirin and clopidogrel treatment have unique platelet function profiles.

----
[INTENSIVE DIABETES TREATMENT]
Intensive diabetes treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have demonstrated the benefits of intensive blood-glucose control in reducing complications in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively.

----
[DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK]
The risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes is increased in patients with type 2 diabetes, and certain medications such as rosiglitazone may further increase this risk. Therefore, it is essential to carefully manage cardiovascular risk factors in patients with diabetes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.
----
[STROKE AND DIABETES]
Stroke is a significant complication in patients with diabetes, and hyperglycemia at the time of stroke can worsen outcomes. Studies have shown that high blood glucose levels can lead to poor recovery and increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Managing blood glucose levels is crucial in the treatment of stroke in patients with diabetes.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT IN STROKE]
Research has investigated the effects of hyperglycemia on stroke outcome, including the impact of admission hyperglycemia on tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients. Some studies suggest that intensive metabolic control using insulin can improve outcomes in patients with diabetes and acute myocardial infarction. However, the optimal management of hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke patients is still being studied.

----
[STROKE TREATMENT AND DIABETES]
Several studies have explored the use of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke, including those with diabetes. The results have been mixed, with some studies showing no improvement in outcomes despite treatment. Other research has investigated the potential benefits of sulfonylureas in improving outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and acute ischemic stroke.

----
[PREVENTION OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM]
The prevention of venous thromboembolism after acute ischemic stroke is an important consideration, particularly in patients with diabetes. Studies have compared the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin for this purpose. Additionally, guidelines have been developed for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol in adults, which are relevant to patients with diabetes.

----
[GUIDELINES FOR DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH]
The Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) have published guidelines for the management of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol in adults. These guidelines are important for healthcare providers managing patients with diabetes, as cardiovascular disease is a major complication of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE]
Patients with diabetes are at a higher risk for cerebrovascular disease, including stroke. The management of cerebrovascular disease in patients with diabetes involves the use of antithrombotic therapy, such as aspirin or clopidogrel. The choice of antithrombotic therapy depends on the individual patient's risk factors and medical history.
----
[ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY IN DIABETES]
Clopidogrel has been shown to have an amplified benefit compared to aspirin in patients with diabetes mellitus. Additionally, antiplatelet agents like cilostazol have been found to be beneficial in diabetic and/or hypertensive ischemic stroke patients. The use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with diabetes requires careful consideration of the individual patient's risk factors and medical history.
----
[MANAGING STROKE RISK IN DIABETES]
The Endocrine Society has published clinical practice guidelines for managing diabetes in patients at metabolic risk. These guidelines emphasize the importance of managing stroke risk factors, such as hypertension and hyperglycemia, in patients with diabetes. By controlling these risk factors, patients with diabetes can reduce their risk of cerebrovascular disease and stroke.
----
[PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE PREVALENCE]
Peripheral arterial disease is very common, affecting up to 30% of all people with diabetes, and amputations occur 5-8 times more often in patients with diabetes than in those without the disease. Atherosclerosis is a common condition in people with diabetes, and measuring ankle blood pressure can help identify it at an early asymptomatic stage. This highlights the importance of regular check-ups for people with diabetes to detect peripheral arterial disease early on.

----
[ATHEROSCLEROSIS IN DIABETES]
Atherosclerosis is the main cause of peripheral arterial vascular disease, and people with diabetes have atherosclerotic lesions located more peripherally than those without diabetes, making them more commonly inoperable for technical reasons. Treatment of atherosclerosis in diabetes is basically the same as in patients without diabetes. However, people with diabetes are more likely to develop symptoms of atherosclerotic complications at a younger age and have more difficulties with treatment.

----
[PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE DEFINITION]
Peripheral arterial disease is a chronic condition that develops over decades, and the World Health Organization (WHO) definition includes exercise-related pain and/or an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of less than 0.9. Diabetes is a major contributor to peripheral arterial disease, which can be divided into four stages: asymptomatic, functional pain, rest pain, and non-healing ulcers or gangrene. Understanding these stages is crucial for providing appropriate care and treatment for people with diabetes.

----
[INCIDENCE OF PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE]
The incidence of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease increases with age, affecting 3-4% of 60- to 65-year-olds and 15-20% of 85- to 90-year-olds in Western Europe and the USA. Asymptomatic cases, where the ABI is less than 0.9, are also common, emphasizing the need for regular screenings to detect peripheral arterial disease in its early stages. Early detection can help prevent complications and improve treatment outcomes for people with diabetes.
----
[PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES]
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a condition that can lead to increased mortality in people with diabetes, primarily due to accompanying cardiovascular disease (CVD). Asymptomatic PVD can be identified through a simple test measuring ankle blood pressure, expressed as the ankle-brachial index (ABI). An ABI of less than 0.9 is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular causes. 
----
[SYMPTOMS OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE]
Symptoms of PVD include claudication, which is pain in the lower limb muscles that appears after walking, and rest pain, which typically occurs at night when the patient is in a horizontal position. Claudication can be incapacitating and signals severe vascular disease, while rest pain is often relieved by standing or sitting up. 
----
[DIABETES AND PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE SYMPTOMATOLOGY]
In patients with diabetes, symptomatology may differ due to coincidental peripheral neuropathy, which can mask symptoms of peripheral ischemia. This is especially important when a patient with diabetes presents with a small ulcer or wound on the lower limb, as the lack of symptoms can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. 
----
[INCIDENCE OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE IN PEOPLE WITH DIABETES]
The incidence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in people with diabetes depends on the usual atherosclerosis risk factors and duration of diabetes. Studies have shown that 20-30% of people with diabetes have PVD, with claudication being twice as common in those with diabetes as those without. Regular assessment of peripheral circulation is recommended for people with diabetes to prevent complications such as non-healing ulcers and gangrene.
----
[DIABETES AND PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE]
Patients with diabetes have a higher risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and its associated mortality, with a further doubling of their risk of death compared to non-diabetic patients. PAD treatment involves managing symptoms from the lower limb and preventing cardiovascular complications. Lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, and interventional therapy are used to treat symptoms, while lifestyle modifications and preventive medical therapy are used to prevent cardiovascular complications. 
----
[SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS OF PAD]
Symptoms of PAD in diabetic patients include rest pain, non-healing ulcers, and/or gangrene, often referred to as critical ischemia. Diagnosis is typically made through history and objective findings, with measurement of ankle blood pressure used to quantify ischemia and monitor disease changes. However, in some diabetic patients, media sclerosis can lead to falsely elevated ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements. 
----
[LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS FOR PAD]
Lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation, regular exercise, weight loss, and dietary changes, are beneficial for patients with PAD, particularly those with diabetes. These changes can help manage symptoms and prevent cardiovascular complications, and are often similar to those recommended for diabetes management. 
----
[PROGNOSIS AND RISK OF AMPUTATION]
The risk of amputation in patients with PAD is relatively low, at 1-2% at 5 years, but the systemic risk is high, with a 15-25% mortality rate and a high risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Patients with diabetes and PAD have an 8 times greater risk of amputation compared to the average patient with PAD. 
----
[DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR PAD]
Measurement of toe pressure using the strain gauge technique is an alternative to ankle pressure measurement, particularly in patients with media sclerosis. Toe pressure is also useful for predicting the healing of ulcers and amputation wounds. Ankle pressure measurement using the Doppler technique is also used to quantify ischemia and monitor disease changes.
----
[PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE IN DIABETES]
Peripheral vascular disease in patients with diabetes often presents with critical limb ischemia, characterized by rest pain, non-healing ulcers, and/or gangrene. The choice of treatment between percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and open surgical management depends on the location and extent of disease. In general, endovascular treatment is preferred for shorter lesions, while open surgery is preferred for extensive occlusive disease. 
----
[LOCATION OF ARTERIAL LESIONS IN DIABETES]
The arterial lesions causing obstruction of blood supply to the lower limb in patients with diabetes are often located in the distal abdominal aorta, iliac arteries, and common and superficial femoral arteries. In patients with diabetes, the arteries in the calf, such as the anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, are often involved, especially in those with critical ischemia. 
----
[PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL ANGIOPLASTY (PTA) IN DIABETES]
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) can be performed anywhere between the heart and the feet, with better results for more centrally located lesions. The shorter the stenosis or occlusion, the better the results, and stenting improves patency in most cases. Primary stenting has become the preferred treatment in most cases, especially for iliac artery obstruction. 
----
[MEDICAL PREVENTION OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE IN DIABETES]
Medical prevention of peripheral vascular disease in patients with diabetes follows the same guidelines as for other clinical atherosclerotic manifestations, including aggressive statin treatment, antiplatelet therapy, and blood pressure control. Lifestyle modification and medical therapy are crucial in managing symptoms and preventing disease progression. 
----
[TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMS FROM THE LOWER LIMB IN DIABETES]
The vast majority of patients with diabetes and peripheral vascular disease should be managed without invasive intervention, with a focus on lifestyle modification and medical therapy to manage symptoms and prevent disease progression. Invasive interventions such as PTA and surgery should be considered carefully, taking into account the location and extent of disease, as well as the patient's overall health status.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS TREATMENT]
Open surgical revascularization is the treatment of choice for critical limb ischemia in diabetes patients, due to the extensive nature of atherosclerotic lesions. For claudication, open surgical treatment is rarely performed, while endarterectomy or bypass surgery may be options. The choice of surgical technique depends on the extent and location of the occlusive lesions. 
----
[ENDARTERECTOMY AND BYPASS SURGERY]
Endarterectomy is a surgical technique that involves removing the atherosclerotic lesion by separating the intima from the media, and is often used for severe occlusive lesions of limited anatomic extension. Bypass surgery is preferred for extensive obstructive and/or occlusive lesions, and can be performed with artificial materials or autologous grafts. 
----
[PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL ANGIOPLASTY (PTA)]
PTA is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to treat occlusive lesions in the iliac and femoral arteries, with or without stenting. The long-term results of PTA without stenting are generally poor, while stenting can improve patency rates. Adjunctive medical therapy, such as antiplatelet drugs, may also be beneficial in improving patency following PTA and stenting. 
----
[PATENCY RATES FOR VASCULAR RECONSTRUCTIONS]
The patency rates for vascular reconstructions vary depending on the location and type of procedure, with open surgery generally having higher patency rates than endovascular procedures. For example, aorto-bifemoral bypass has a 10-year patency rate of 80%, while femoral-popliteal PTA with stenting has a 3-year patency rate of 64%.
----
[PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of complications from peripheral vascular disease treatments, with a doubling of risk expected, especially with open surgery. This is due to the more advanced level of generalized atherosclerotic disease in patients with diabetes. Complications can include wound healing problems, infections, and systemic complications such as cardiopulmonary issues. 
----
[PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Treatment options for peripheral vascular disease include endovascular treatment and open surgical revascularization. Endovascular treatment involves minimally invasive procedures, while open surgical revascularization involves bypass grafts, which can be made from autologous veins or artificial materials. The choice of treatment depends on the location and severity of the disease. 
----
[PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE TREATMENT RISKS]
Risks associated with endovascular treatment include hematoma, pseudo-aneurysm, and peripheral embolization, while open surgical revascularization carries risks such as wound complications, infections, and systemic complications like cardiopulmonary issues. The risk of complications is higher in patients with diabetes, especially those undergoing open surgery. 
----
[DIABETES AND PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE]
Diabetes is a significant factor in the development and treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Patients with diabetes are more likely to experience complications from treatment and have a higher risk of limb-threatening ischemia. Therefore, it is essential to consider the patient's diabetes status when determining the best course of treatment for peripheral vascular disease.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE LOWER LIMB ISCHEMIA]
Diagnosis of acute lower limb ischemia is often easy with typical clinical signs, and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) will be low, if measurable at all. Imaging techniques such as duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) can be used, but may delay treatment. In cases of thrombosis, arteriography with subsequent thrombolysis is often desirable to visualize the underlying pathology.
----
[PROGNOSIS OF ACUTE LOWER LIMB ISCHEMIA]
The prognosis of acute lower limb ischemia is dependent on the ability to perform revascularization before irreversible ischemia has occurred, in which case the limb can be salvaged and normal function regained. However, co-morbidity is high, and procedure-related mortality is 10-20% due to the release of toxic substances from ischemic tissue and existing cardiac disease.
----
[TREATMENT OF ACUTE LOWER LIMB ISCHEMIA]
Treatment of acute lower limb ischemia may involve endovascular or open surgery, with endovascular treatment preferred if revascularization is not imminent. Catheter-directed intra-arterial thrombolysis can expose underlying atherosclerotic lesions, which can be treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or stenting. In some cases, bypass surgery may be necessary, and embolectomy can be used to treat emboli.
----
[PREVENTION OF ACUTE LOWER LIMB ISCHEMIA]
Prevention of acute lower limb ischemia involves treating the underlying cause, such as atrial fibrillation, and addressing existing atherosclerosis. Patients with diabetes have a poorer outcome of vascular reconstructions, with lower patency rates and more complications, including infections and systemic complications.
----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ACUTE LOWER LIMB ISCHEMIA]
The pathophysiology of acute lower limb ischemia involves thrombosis caused by plaque rupture and subsequent thrombosis, which can lead to further thrombosis due to slow arterial flow and hypercoagulable conditions. The degree of ischemia depends on the location and degree of collateral development, with thrombosis often being better tolerated than embolism due to the presence of collaterals in patients with existing atherosclerosis.
----
[PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE OVERVIEW]
Peripheral vascular disease can affect various parts of the body, including the arms, and is often caused by atherosclerosis or other conditions such as Takayasu vasculitis. Symptoms of chronic arm ischemia include pain when using the arm, particularly when performing tasks with the arms elevated. Diagnosis can be made through physical examination, measurement of bilateral blood pressure, and imaging studies such as ultrasound or angiography.

----
[CHRONIC ARM ISCHEMIA SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS]
Chronic arm ischemia typically presents with symptoms such as claudication, or pain when using the arm, especially when performing tasks with the arms elevated. Diagnosis is often made through physical examination, including palpation of pulses and measurement of bilateral blood pressure. Additional diagnostic tools such as Doppler devices, finger pressure measurement, and imaging studies like CT or MRA may also be used.

----
[TREATMENT OF UPPER EXTREMITY ATHEROSCLEROSIS]
Treatment of upper extremity atherosclerosis typically involves risk factor reduction through lifestyle changes and preventive medications, as well as revascularization in some cases. Endovascular treatment is often preferred due to its less invasive nature, while bypass surgery may be indicated for lesions that cannot be treated endovascularly. The goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications such as critical ischemia and gangrene.

----
[ACUTE ARM ISCHEMIA CAUSES AND TREATMENT]
Acute arm ischemia is often caused by embolization or thrombosis in an existing stenosis, and treatment depends on the underlying cause. Embolism may be treated with embolectomy, while thrombosis may require intra-arterial thrombolysis and vascular reconstruction. Identifying and addressing the underlying source of embolism, such as cardiac or vascular causes, is crucial in preventing further episodes.

----
[ATHEROSCLEROSIS OF RENAL AND MESENTERIC ARTERIES]
Atherosclerosis of the renal and mesenteric arteries can cause significant complications, including severe hypertension and renal failure. Renal artery obstruction can be treated with endovascular management, which is often preferred due to its less invasive nature. Mesenteric artery occlusive disease can cause abdominal angina, and treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the presence of other underlying conditions.
----
[ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM OVERVIEW]
Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common in many patients, especially the elderly, and can be asymptomatic. Inflammatory aneurysms are present in 5-10% of AAA cases, where the aortic wall is thickened due to perianeurysmal or retroperitoneal fibrosis. Symptoms from AAA are rare, and diagnosis is often made coincidentally through ultrasound or other imaging tests.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF AAA]
Diagnosis of AAA is easy, and ultrasound is very accurate in making the diagnosis and estimating the diameter of the aneurysm. In some cases, a primary CT scan may be necessary, and arteriography is rarely performed for AAA. A patient with acute abdominal pain in pre-shock should always be suspected of ruptured AAA.

----
[COMPLICATIONS AND TREATMENT OF AAA]
Aneurysms may cause peripheral embolization, leading to cyanotic or gangrenous toes. Treatment of peripheral ischemia may include thrombolysis, and eradication of the embolic source is crucial. Patients with diabetes are more prone to complications after surgery for aneurysms, but this rarely changes management once the risk of surgery has been weighed against non-surgical treatment.

----
[PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS OF AAA]
The prevalence of AAA is approximately 5% in men over 70 years of age, and the incidence is 2-3 times greater in patients with other atherosclerotic manifestations, such as PAD or carotid disease. There is a 2:1 ratio of AAA occurring in men: women, and the tendency to develop AAA is partly inherited. People with diabetes seem to have a slightly lower incidence of AAA, approximately 80% of the prevalence of those without diabetes.
----
[MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES]
Macrovascular complications in diabetes can lead to aneurysms, which are often asymptomatic but can cause symptoms due to compression, peripheral embolization, or thrombosis. Treatment for aneurysms is similar to that for atherosclerotic disease and may involve surgical intervention or endovascular management. Popliteal and femoral aneurysms are typically treated surgically, while endovascular management is still being developed and its indications are unclear.
----
[ANEURYSM TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Treatment options for aneurysms include open surgical repair, which carries a risk of complications such as cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications, as well as endovascular treatment, which involves inserting a collapsed prosthesis via the femoral artery. Endovascular treatment has fewer perioperative complications but may require reinterventions, which can often be performed using endovascular techniques.
----
[SCREENING FOR ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSMS]
Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is now well-documented and recommended for men over 65 years old and previous smokers. Ultrasound screening can reduce aneurysm-related mortality by 43%, and family members of those affected should also undergo screening. Early detection and treatment can help prevent complications and improve outcomes.
----
[PERIPHERAL ANEURYSMS]
Peripheral aneurysms can develop in locations such as the popliteal and femoral arteries and are often associated with AAAs. Symptoms of peripheral aneurysms can differ from those of AAAs, and treatment options include surgical exclusion and bypass or resection and replacement with a graft. Endovascular management is also possible, but its indications are still unclear.
----
[CAROTID STENOSIS AND DIABETES]
Carotid stenosis is a condition that can increase the risk of stroke, and its prevalence is high among patients with atherosclerotic manifestations. The risk of stroke is increased in the presence of carotid stenosis, especially in symptomatic patients. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis, and therefore, carotid stenosis. 
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF CAROTID STENOSIS]
Diagnosis of carotid disease should be carried out by duplex ultrasound scanning, which is a well-documented method for identifying and quantifying the degree of stenosis. This diagnostic approach is crucial for patients with diabetes who are at a higher risk of developing carotid stenosis.
----
[TREATMENT OF CAROTID STENOSIS]
Treatment of patients with carotid stenosis involves risk factor reduction, including changes in lifestyle, which is similar to the treatment approach for patients with other clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. For patients with diabetes, managing blood sugar levels and controlling other risk factors, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, is essential in preventing the progression of carotid stenosis.
----
[PROGNOSIS OF CAROTID STENOSIS]
The risk of stroke is increased in the presence of carotid stenosis, and the annual risk of ipsilateral stroke is approximately 2% for asymptomatic patients with a carotid stenosis exceeding 60% diameter reduction. For symptomatic patients, the risk is much higher, especially just after the first event, highlighting the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment, particularly in patients with diabetes who are already at a higher risk of cardiovascular complications.
----
[CAROTID STENOSIS TREATMENT]
Carotid stenting has not been proven to prevent ipsilateral ischemic events in randomized clinical trials, with seven trials comparing stenting to endarterectomy showing no advantage in perioperative events. In fact, the EVA-3S trial was stopped early due to excess complications in the stenting group. A Cochrane meta-analysis favors surgery over stenting with respect to perioperative death and ipsilateral stroke. 
----
[CAROTID STENOSIS RISK FACTORS]
Male sex, older age, and severity of stenosis increase the risk of future stroke in patients with stenosis, making the overall benefit of surgery greater in these patients. The benefit of surgery is also influenced by factors such as sex, age, and degree of stenosis. 
----
[ASYMPTOMATIC CAROTID STENOSIS]
Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is a more controversial topic, with two major trials showing a small but statistically significant benefit of surgery. However, the absolute risk reduction is marginal, and the cost-benefit of surgery may be questioned. The medical treatment offered during these trials was poorer than current recommendations, which may affect the outcomes. 
----
[CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY TECHNIQUE]
Carotid endarterectomy can be performed in two ways: classic endarterectomy or eversion endarterectomy. The procedure can be done under general or local anesthesia, with general anesthesia being the classic choice, but local anesthesia is also an option. Various methods have been used to monitor cerebral circulation during clamping of the carotid artery, but none have proven ideal.
----
[PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE IN DIABETES]
Peripheral vascular disease is a significant concern in patients with diabetes, with a low ankle-brachial index (ABI) and high homocysteine level being associated with increased risk. Studies have shown that patients with peripheral arterial disease have a higher risk of mortality and limb loss. Diabetes is a major risk factor for peripheral vascular disease, and managing diabetes is crucial in preventing and treating this condition.

----
[DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE]
Diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease involves measuring the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and assessing symptoms such as claudication. Management options include exercise, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, and revascularization procedures such as angioplasty and bypass surgery. The Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) provides guidelines for the management of peripheral arterial disease.

----
[RISK OF CARDIAC DEATH AND LIMB LOSS IN DIABETES]
Patients with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease are at increased risk of cardiac death and limb loss. Studies have shown that the risk of cardiac death is higher in patients with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease compared to those without diabetes. Regular monitoring and management of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease are essential to prevent these complications.

----
[SCREENING AND PREVENTION OF ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSMS]
Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms is important in patients with diabetes and peripheral vascular disease. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men aged 65-75 who have ever smoked. Early detection and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms can prevent rupture and reduce mortality.
----
[CAROTID STENOSIS TREATMENT]
Carotid endarterectomy and stenting are two treatment options for carotid stenosis, a condition that increases the risk of stroke in patients with diabetes. Studies have shown that these procedures can be effective in preventing disabling and fatal strokes. The choice between endarterectomy and stenting depends on various factors, including the severity of stenosis and the patient's overall health.
----
[ANAESTHESIA FOR CAROTID SURGERY]
The use of local versus general anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy has been studied, with some trials suggesting that local anaesthesia may be associated with fewer complications. However, the choice of anaesthesia ultimately depends on the individual patient's needs and the surgeon's preference.
----
[STATIN THERAPY FOR STROKE PREVENTION]
High-dose atorvastatin has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. This suggests that statin therapy may be an important component of diabetes care, particularly for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.
----
[BEST MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR CAROTID ATHEROSCLEROSIS]
The concept of "best medical treatment" for carotid atherosclerosis is evolving, but it generally includes a combination of lifestyle modifications, antiplatelet therapy, and statin therapy. The goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes and carotid stenosis.
----
[DIABETES FOOT PROBLEMS PREVALENCE]
Diabetic foot problems remain the most common cause of hospital admissions amongst patients with diabetes in Western countries, with up to 50% of older patients with type 2 diabetes having risk factors for foot problems. Up to 85% of lower limb amputations are preceded by foot ulcers, and foot ulceration is common, affecting up to 25% of patients with diabetes during their lifetime. Regular screening and prevention strategies are crucial to reducing the risk of foot problems.

----
[DIABETES FOOT CARE RECOMMENDATIONS]
All patients with diabetes should be screened for risk of foot problems on an annual basis, and those with risk factors require regular podiatry, patient education, and instruction in self-foot care. Most foot ulcers should heal if pressure is removed from the ulcer site, the arterial circulation is sufficient, and infection is managed and treated aggressively. Any patient with a warm unilateral swollen foot without ulceration should be presumed to have an acute Charcot neuroarthropathy until proven otherwise.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION]
Prevention is the first step towards solving diabetic foot problems, and up to 85% of all amputations in diabetes should be preventable. Strategies aimed at preventing foot ulcers are cost-effective and can even be cost-saving if increased education and effort are focused on those patients with recognized risk factors for the development of foot problems. Diabetes is now the most common cause of Charcot neuroarthropathy in Western countries, another condition that should be generally preventable.

----
[PROGRESS IN DIABETIC FOOT CARE]
Much progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis and management of the diabetic foot over the last quarter century, with an increasing number of publications in peer-reviewed journals. The percentage of PubMed-listed articles on the diabetic foot has increased from 0.7% in the 1980-1988 period to more than 2.7% in the years 1998-2004, indicating a growing focus on this important aspect of diabetes care.
----
[DIABETIC FOOT COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetic foot complications are a major medical, social, and economic problem worldwide, affecting all types of diabetes and resulting in high rates of non-traumatic amputation. The frequency of amputation and ulceration varies across regions due to differences in diagnostic criteria and regional factors. Diabetes remains a leading cause of non-traumatic amputation, with rates up to 15 times higher than in the non-diabetic population. 
----
[EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETIC FOOT DISEASE]
The epidemiology of diabetic foot disease is complex, with varying definitions of foot ulcers and methodologic issues making it difficult to compare studies. Despite these challenges, it is estimated that 40-70% of patients with diabetes have risk factors for foot ulceration, highlighting the need for regular screening programs. 
----
[HEALTH ECONOMICS OF DIABETIC FOOT DISEASE]
Diabetic foot ulceration and amputations have substantial economic consequences, with estimated costs to US healthcare payers of $10.9 billion in 2001. The economic burden of diabetic foot disease underscores the importance of prevention and effective management of foot ulcers. 
----
[IMPORTANCE OF SCREENING AND PREVENTION]
Regular screening programs are essential to identify individuals with diabetes who are at high risk of foot ulceration, allowing for early intervention and prevention of late sequelae of neuropathy and vascular disease. This can help reduce the morbidity, mortality, and economic burden associated with diabetic foot disease.
----
[DIABETES FOOT PROBLEMS]
Foot problems in patients with diabetes are not an inevitable consequence of having diabetes, but rather result from an interaction between specific pathologies in the lower limb and environmental hazards. The breakdown of the diabetic foot is traditionally considered to result from an interaction of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), peripheral neuropathy, and some form of trauma. Other causes are also contributing factors. The combination of these risk factors with minor trauma can lead to ulceration.

----
[PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE]
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) tends to occur at a younger age in patients with diabetes and is more likely to involve distal vessels. PVD is a major contributory factor in the pathogenesis of foot ulceration and subsequent major amputations. In isolation, PVD rarely causes ulceration, but the combination of PVD with minor trauma and neuropathy can lead to ischemic ulceration and increased risk of amputation.

----
[DIABETIC NEUROPATHY]
Diabetic neuropathy is the most common form of long-term complications of diabetes, affecting different parts of the nervous system and presenting with diverse clinical manifestations. The most common form of neuropathy is chronic sensorimotor distal symmetrical neuropathy. Neuropathy can increase the risk of foot ulcers, especially when combined with PVD and minor trauma.

----
[COST OF DIABETIC FOOT COMPLICATIONS]
The total annual costs of diabetes-related foot complications are significant, with estimates ranging from £252 million in the UK to $30.6 billion in the USA. The costs of diabetic foot ulcers and lower extremity amputations are substantial, with potential savings of up to $21.8 billion possible with realistic reductions in ulceration and amputation.

----
[ETIOPATHOGENESIS OF DIABETIC FOOT LESIONS]
The development of diabetic foot ulcers is a complex process involving multiple causative factors, including PVD, neuropathy, and minor trauma. Understanding the pathways that lead to ulcer development is crucial for reducing the incidence of foot ulcers and amputations. Identifying warning signs or "shadows" can help identify individuals at risk before an ulcer occurs.
----
[DIABETIC FOOT ULCERATION]
Diabetic foot ulcers are a significant complication of diabetes, and the loss of pain due to neuropathy can lead to diminished motivation in healing and prevention of injury. Peripheral sympathetic autonomic neuropathy can cause reduced sweating, dry skin, and increased blood flow, leading to a warm foot prone to ulcers. A past history of similar problems is a significant risk factor for ulceration, with an annual risk of re-ulceration of up to 50%. 

----
[NEUROPATHY AND FOOT ULCERS]
Sensorimotor neuropathy and peripheral autonomic sympathetic neuropathy play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of foot ulcers. Sensorimotor neuropathy is common in older patients with type 2 diabetes, with up to 50% showing evidence of sensory loss on clinical examination. This type of neuropathy can result in sensory loss, motor dysfunction, and small muscle wasting, making patients at risk of insensitive foot injury.

----
[RISK FACTORS FOR FOOT ULCERS]
Patients with a history of foot ulcers, nephropathy, and those on dialysis or with renal transplants are at high risk of developing foot ulcers. Even patients with normoglycemia after a pancreas transplant are at risk of ulceration. A careful foot exam is essential to assess foot ulcer risk, as neuropathic symptoms correlate poorly with sensory loss, and their absence does not equate to a lack of foot ulcer risk.

----
[SYMPTOMATIC SPECTRUM OF NEUROPATHY]
The symptomatic severity of neuropathy can vary, with some patients experiencing severe pain and others having no spontaneous symptoms. However, both groups can have significant sensory loss, making them at risk of foot ulceration. The absence of neuropathic symptoms should not be equated with a lack of foot ulcer risk, and regular foot self-care is essential to prevent ulcers.
----
[DIABETES FOOT ULCERATION RISK FACTORS]
The combination of two or more risk factors, such as neuropathy, deformity, and trauma, ultimately results in diabetic foot ulceration. According to the Rothman model for causation, a component cause is not sufficient in itself to lead to ulceration, but when component causes act together, they result in a sufficient cause that will inevitably lead to ulceration. The most common triad of component causes present in nearly two out of three incident foot ulcer cases is neuropathy, deformity, and trauma. Edema and ischemia are also common component causes.

----
[PREVENTION OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS]
The vast majority of foot ulcers are potentially preventable, and the first step in prevention is the identification of the "at risk" population through annual screening. Many countries have adopted the principle of the "annual review" for patients with diabetes, whereby every patient is screened at least annually for evidence of diabetic complications. A comprehensive diabetic foot examination (CDFE) should include a careful examination of the foot, assessing its neurologic and vascular status, and using simple clinical tests as predictors of risk of foot ulcers.

----
[COMPREHENSIVE DIABETIC FOOT EXAMINATION]
A comprehensive diabetic foot examination (CDFE) should include a brief history and a careful examination of the foot, including assessing its neurologic and vascular status. The CDFE should also include an assessment of neuropathy, such as the 10-g monofilament test, which has much evidence to support its use. A summary of the key components of the CDFE is provided in Table 44.3, and each potential simple neurologic clinical test has advantages and disadvantages.

----
[PLANTAR CALLUS AND FOOT ULCERATION]
Callus forms under weight-bearing areas as a consequence of dry skin, insensitivity, and repetitive moderate stress from high foot pressure, and acts as a foreign body that can cause ulceration. The presence of callus in an insensate foot should alert the physician that this patient is at high risk of ulceration, and callus should be removed by a podiatrist or other trained health care professional.

----
[ELEVATED FOOT PRESSURES AND FOOT DEFORMITY]
Numerous studies have confirmed the contributory role that abnormal plantar pressures play in the pathogenesis of foot ulcers. A combination of motor neuropathy, cheiroarthropathy, and altered gait patterns can result in the "high risk" neuropathic foot with clawing of the toes, prominent metatarsal heads, and other deformities. Elevated foot pressures and foot deformity are important risk factors for diabetic foot ulceration.
----
[FOOT ULCER PREVENTION]
Foot care education is crucial in preventing ulceration, but there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials to support its effectiveness. Patients often struggle to understand the concept of neuropathy, and visual aids such as the Neuropad or PressureStat can help them comprehend the risks. These tools can identify high-risk feet and areas prone to ulceration, enabling patients to take preventive measures. 
----
[PODIATRY AND FOOT CARE]
Regular nail and skin care from a podiatrist or chiropodist is essential for high-risk neuropathic feet. Self-care attempts can lead to ulceration, and patients should be discouraged from self-caring for calluses. Podiatrists and chiropodists can educate patients while treating their feet, making them a valuable part of the foot care team.
----
[FOOTWEAR AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES]
Inappropriate footwear is a common cause of foot ulceration in insensitive feet, while good footwear can reduce ulcer occurrence. Specialist hosiery can also reduce foot pressures and provide protection for high-risk neuropathic feet. Randomized controlled trials support the use of proper footwear and hosiery in preventing foot ulcers.
----
[NEUROPATHY ASSESSMENT]
Assessment of vibration perception threshold is a semi-quantitative test of sensation that can predict foot ulceration. While not essential, it is a useful tool in identifying patients at risk. The ankle brachial index is also recommended to assess vasculature, although its feasibility in primary care settings may be limited.
----
[FOOT ULCER CLASSIFICATION]
Foot ulcers in diabetic patients can be classified using various systems, with the Meggitt-Wagner grading being the most widely used worldwide. This system helps in assessing the severity of the ulcer and guiding management. However, it has its limitations and other classification systems are also available. Accurate classification is crucial for effective management of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.
----
[FOOT ULCER MANAGEMENT]
The management of foot ulcers in diabetic patients depends on a careful assessment of the causative factors, presence or absence of infection, degree of neuropathy, and ischemia in the foot. A comprehensive approach is necessary to prevent and manage foot ulcers, including early identification, preventive foot care education, and regular monitoring. This can help reduce the risk of complications and improve outcomes.
----
[SELF-MONITORING OF SKIN TEMPERATURE]
Self-monitoring of skin temperature can help identify pre-ulcerative changes in the foot, allowing for early intervention and prevention of ulceration. Studies have shown that patients who monitor their skin temperatures and take appropriate action have a reduced incidence of recurrent ulceration. This simple and non-invasive method can be a valuable tool in the prevention of foot ulcers.
----
[PREVENTION OF NEUROPATHIC FOOT ULCERS]
Prevention of neuropathic foot ulcers requires a multifaceted approach, including daily foot exams, proper footwear, and regular podiatry care. Patients should also be educated on how to inspect their feet, avoid repetitive trauma, and maintain good foot hygiene. Adherence to off-loading and other preventive measures can help reduce the risk of foot ulcers and related complications.
----
[INJECTED LIQUID SILICONE THERAPY]
Injected liquid silicone under high-pressure areas of the diabetic foot has been shown to reduce foot pressures and prevent ulceration. This therapy has been used in some countries and has been supported by randomized controlled trials, with effects lasting up to 2 years. However, booster injections may be required from time to time to maintain the benefits.
----
[DIABETIC FOOT ULCER CLASSIFICATION]
The Meggitt-Wagner classification system is used to classify diabetic foot ulcers, with grades ranging from 0 (no ulcer, but high risk foot) to 5 (gangrene of whole foot). The University of Texas (UT) wound classification system is also widely used, which adds stages for the presence or absence of infection and ischemia. This system is based on the Meggitt-Wagner system but provides more detailed information about the ulcer. The UT system has been shown to be a useful predictor of outcome.

----
[DIABETIC FOOT ULCER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS]
Other classification systems, such as the S(AD)SAD system and the PEDIS system, have been described, but are not in widespread use. The UT system is currently the most commonly used system for classifying diabetic foot ulcers. These systems help healthcare professionals to assess the severity of the ulcer and develop an appropriate treatment plan. The classification systems take into account the depth, size, and presence of infection or ischemia of the ulcer.

----
[WOUND HEALING IN DIABETIC FOOT]
Wound healing in diabetic foot is a complex process that involves several phases, including inflammation, chemotaxis, cellular proliferation, and extracellular matrix deposition. Diabetes can impair wound healing by affecting peripheral circulation, leukocyte function, and the balance of cytokines and proteases. Chronic hyperglycemia can also impede the wound healing process. As a result, foot ulcers in patients with diabetes are often difficult to heal and may become stalled in the chronic inflammatory phase.

----
[MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR IMPAIRMENTS]
Research has shown that chronic diabetic foot ulcers have abnormalities in cytokines and growth factors, which can impede the wound healing process. Studies have also suggested that levels of matrix metalloproteases are altered in tissue from chronic diabetic foot ulcers. Understanding these molecular and cellular impairments is crucial to developing effective treatments for diabetic foot ulcers. Further research is needed to identify the specific impairments and develop targeted therapies to improve wound healing in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES-RELATED FOOT PROBLEMS]
Foot problems in patients with diabetes can lead to serious complications, including foot ulcers. A Wagner grade I ulcer, for example, is a neuropathic ulcer that can appear as a punched-out lesion in the metatarsal head region with a rim of callus and no evidence of infection. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play a crucial role in wound healing, and high levels of MMP-1 are essential for healing to occur.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF OFFLOADING]
Offloading is a critical component in the management of neuropathic plantar foot ulcers in patients with diabetes. By reducing pressure on the wound, offloading can promote healing. Total Contact Casts (TCC) are often used to offload the wound and have been shown to be effective in promoting wound healing. The principle of TCC management is to mitigate pressure and enforce compliance with therapy.

----
[COMPLIANCE WITH OFFLOADING DEVICES]
Compliance with offloading devices, such as Removable Cast Walkers (RCW), is crucial for effective wound healing. However, studies have shown that patients may not wear RCWs as directed, with one study finding that patients only wore the RCW for 28% of all footsteps. To address this issue, modifying the RCW to make it irremovable has been proposed as a solution.

----
[IMPACT OF OFFLOADING ON WOUND HEALING]
Appropriate offloading can have a positive impact on the histopathologic features of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers. Studies have shown that offloading can result in the foot wound appearing more like an acute wound, with reparative patterns, angiogenesis, and fibroblast proliferation. In contrast, biopsies from wounds that had not been offloaded showed chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

----
[EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND WOUND HEALING]
Emotional distress, such as depression and anxiety, can have a negative impact on wound healing in patients with diabetes. Emotional distress can alter catecholamine and steroid secretion, as well as cytokine balance, which can directly impair wound healing. Additionally, patients with emotional distress may be less likely to adhere to treatment advice, such as wearing an RCW.
----
[DIABETES FOOT ULCER MANAGEMENT]
The management of foot ulcers in diabetic patients involves determining whether an infection is present, and if so, treating it accordingly. The diagnosis of infection in diabetic foot ulcers is typically clinical, based on signs such as purulent discharge, erythema, local warmth, and swelling. The presence of these signs suggests infection requiring appropriate treatment. 
----
[CLINICALLY NON-INFECTED ULCERS]
For non-infected ulcers that are predominantly neuropathic, the use of antibiotics may be withheld, and management should focus on frequent review, debridement, callus removal, and offloading. However, if signs of infection develop, antibiotics may be necessary. For ulcers with an ischemic component, antibiotics should probably be given even in the absence of gross signs of infection.
----
[CLINICALLY INFECTED ULCERS]
Infected ulcers can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe, and treatment should be guided by the severity of the infection. Non-limb-threatening infected ulcers can generally be treated on an outpatient basis with oral broad-spectrum antibiotics, while any ulcer with clinical evidence of infection should have tissue taken and sent for culture and sensitivity. 
----
[DRESSINGS AND WOUND CARE]
The choice of dressing for a diabetic foot ulcer has little impact on the rate of wound healing, and healthcare professionals should not rely solely on dressings for treatment. The three most important factors in healing a diabetic foot ulcer are freedom from pressure, adequate blood supply, and a clean, moist environment.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY FOR OSTEOMYELITIS]
A combination of clinical and laboratory findings, including ulcer depth and serum inflammatory markers, can improve diagnostic accuracy for osteomyelitis in diabetic foot patients. This approach is particularly sensitive and can help identify cases that may be managed with long-term antibiotic therapy. However, more research is needed to inform treatment choices. 

----
[MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOMYELITIS]
Localized osteomyelitis can be managed with long-term antibiotic therapy, especially in cases where the infection is confined to one bone without joint involvement and there is no peripheral vascular disease. In some cases, localized bony resection after antibiotic therapy may be necessary. 

----
[ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS]
Newer approaches to promote healing in diabetic foot lesions include growth factors, hyperbaric oxygen, and negative pressure wound therapy. These therapies aim to modify abnormalities in the wound bed or surrounding tissues, but their use is limited by lack of consensus and high costs. 

----
[GROWTH FACTORS FOR WOUND HEALING]
Growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), have been described to promote wound healing, but their use is limited by lack of robust data and high costs. Most neuropathic ulcers can be healed with appropriate offloading, making the use of growth factors less necessary. 

----
[HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY]
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been promoted for managing non-healing diabetic foot ulcers, but its use is limited by poorly designed studies and lack of robust data. Some small, well-designed trials have shown potential benefits, but more research is needed to confirm efficacy and clarify which wounds may benefit from this treatment. 

----
[NEGATIVE PRESSURE WOUND THERAPY]
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has emerged as a common treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, using vacuum-assisted closure to promote healing. This therapy has shown potential benefits, but more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and optimal use. 

----
[ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIPTION FOR DIABETIC FOOT INFECTIONS]
Antibiotic prescription for diabetic foot infections should be guided by sensitivities from tissue specimens, with targeted narrow-spectrum agents prescribed when available. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, can be used as initial treatment while waiting for sensitivity results. 

----
[LIMB-THREATENING INFECTIONS]
Patients with limb-threatening infections require hospitalization, parenteral antibiotics, and assessment of circulation with non-invasive studies. Deep wound and blood cultures should be taken to guide treatment and prevent further complications.
----
[CHARCOT NEUROARTHROPATHY PATHOGENESIS]
Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) is a non-infective arthropathy that occurs in a well-perfused insensate foot, with an unclear exact mechanism underlying its development. The classic neurotraumatic and neurotrophic theories for the pathogenesis of acute CN in diabetes do not address certain key features of the disease. Research suggests that the RANKL-dependent pathway is important in the pathogenesis of acute CN, and inhibition of RANKL might be useful in management. 
----
[CHARCOT NEUROARTHROPATHY TREATMENT]
The treatment of Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) depends on the stage of the disease, with offloading of the affected foot using a plaster cast being the most effective method in the acute phase. Bisphosphonates, such as intravenous pamidronate, have been shown to reduce disease activity in acute CN. Custom-molded shoes with appropriate insoles are indicated once the swelling and hyperemia have resolved.
----
[NEGATIVE PRESSURE WOUND THERAPY]
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a commonly employed option in the treatment of complex wounds of the diabetic foot, optimizing blood flow, decreasing local tissue edema, and removing excessive fluid and pro-inflammatory exudates from the wound bed. Controlled trial evidence supports the use of NPWT in both local postoperative wounds and complex but non-surgical diabetic foot ulcers, promoting the formation of granulation tissue.
----
[BIOENGINEERED SKIN SUBSTITUTES]
Bioengineered skin substitutes have some evidence to support their use in non-infected neuropathic ulcers, but their use is restricted by cost and limited by the quality of available trials. A systematic review concluded that high-quality studies are needed to make recommendations for the use of these skin substitutes.
----
[CHARCOT NEUROARTHROPATHY CLINICAL PRESENTATION]
Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) typically presents with a warm, swollen foot, which may be painful or accompanied by discomfort in the affected limb. The affected patient tends to be slightly younger than those presenting with a diabetic foot ulcer, and a history of trauma may be present, although it is rarely significant.
----
[DIABETIC FOOT CARE TEAM]
The management of complex lesions of the diabetic foot requires a team approach, involving diabetologists, surgeons, specialist nurses, podiatrists, orthotists, and other healthcare professionals. This team approach is strongly recommended to improve the overall outlook for the diabetic foot. The patient's willing participation is crucial, as without it, the team's efforts may be limited.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF PATIENT PARTICIPATION]
The patient at risk of, or with foot ulceration, must be regarded as the most important member of the diabetic foot care team. Their participation and cooperation are essential for the team to achieve its goals and improve the overall outlook for the diabetic foot. Without patient participation, the team's efforts may be hindered, and the patient's outcomes may be compromised.

----
[GLOBAL BURDEN OF DIABETIC FOOT DISEASE]
The global burden of diabetic foot disease is significant, with a high incidence of foot ulcers and amputations among patients with diabetes. The prevalence of diabetic foot disease is likely to increase in the next few decades due to the global explosion of type 2 diabetes. Diabetic foot disease carries significant morbidity and mortality, making early identification, prevention, and aggressive treatment crucial.

----
[RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DIABETIC FOOT CARE]
Early identification, prevention, and aggressive treatment of diabetic foot problems are essential to reduce the incidence of diabetic foot disease.

A comprehensive foot examination and risk assessment are essential for preventing diabetic foot ulcers.

----
[FOOT EXAMINATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT]
A comprehensive foot examination and risk assessment are crucial for preventing diabetic foot ulcers. This involves evaluating the patient's foot health, identifying risk factors, and implementing preventive measures. Several studies have emphasized the importance of regular foot exams and risk assessments in patients with diabetes.

----
[PREVENTION OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS]
Preventing diabetic foot ulcers requires a multifaceted approach, including education, proper foot care, and the use of specialized footwear and insoles. Studies have shown that manufactured shoes, experimental padded hosiery, and multilayered hosiery can help reduce abnormal foot pressures in diabetic neuropathy. Temperature monitoring and skin temperature monitoring can also be used as self-assessment tools to prevent diabetic foot ulcer recurrence.

----
[PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF DIABETIC FOOT COMPLICATIONS]
Psychological aspects, such as anxiety and depression, can play a significant role in diabetic foot complications. Research has highlighted the importance of addressing the psychological and behavioral aspects of diabetic foot lesions, including the use of education and counseling to promote self-care and foot health.

----
[TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS]
Treatment and management of diabetic foot ulcers involve a range of strategies, including the use of injected liquid silicone to reduce risk factors for ulceration. Studies have shown that silicone injections can reduce peak plantar pressure and plantar tissue thickness, thereby reducing the risk of ulceration. Other treatments, such as wound care and off-loading, are also essential for promoting healing and preventing recurrence.
----
[DIABETES FOOT ULCERS TREATMENT]
Diabetic foot ulcers can be treated with various methods, including antimicrobial treatments, larval therapy, and negative pressure wound therapy. Research has shown that these treatments can be effective in eliminating infections and promoting wound healing. For example, a study published in Diabetes Care found that larval therapy can eliminate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from diabetic foot ulcers.

----
[DIAGNOSING OSTEOMYELITIS]
Osteomyelitis, a bone infection, can be difficult to diagnose in patients with diabetes. However, a combination of clinical and laboratory testing can improve diagnostic accuracy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also play a role in evaluating suspected osteomyelitis in diabetic foot patients. A study published in Radiol Med found that MRI can be useful in evaluating diabetic foot with suspected osteomyelitis.

----
[TREATMENT OF OSTEOMYELITIS]
The treatment of osteomyelitis in diabetic patients can be challenging, but primarily non-surgical management can be effective. A study published in Diabetologia found that non-surgical management of osteomyelitis of the foot in diabetes can be a viable option. Additionally, a systematic review published in Diabet Metab Res Rev discussed the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS]
The management of diabetic foot ulcers requires a comprehensive approach, including wound care, infection control, and offloading. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been shown to be effective in promoting wound healing. A study published in Diabetes Care found that NPWT can be effective in treating diabetic foot ulcers. However, unresolved issues in the management of ulcers of the foot in diabetes still exist, as discussed in a study published in Diabet Med.

----
[ROLE OF HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY]
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been studied as a potential treatment for diabetic foot wounds, but its effectiveness is still debated. A study published in Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg found that hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be beneficial in treating ischemic diabetic lower extremity ulcers, while another study published in Clin Infect Dis argued that it is not effective.
----
[DIABETIC FOOT CARE]
The prevention of lower extremity amputations in diabetes can be achieved through educating the multidisciplinary team and the patient, as well as providing better organized diabetes foot care. Studies have shown a reduction in diabetic amputations over time with the implementation of these strategies. For example, the Leverkusen Amputation Reduction Study (LARS) found a reduced incidence of lower-limb amputations in the diabetic population of a German city from 1990 to 2005.

----
[DIABETIC AMPUTATIONS]
Research has consistently shown that multidisciplinary team work and continuous prospective audit can lead to a reduction in diabetic amputations. A study in a defined UK population found a reduction in diabetic amputations over 11 years, highlighting the benefits of teamwork and audit. Another study found a sustained reduction in major amputations in diabetic patients over a 20-year period.

----
[CHARCOT NEUROARTHROPATHY]
Charcot neuroarthropathy is a condition that can affect people with diabetes, characterized by increased osteoclastic activity. Bisphosphonates have been studied as a potential treatment for Charcot neuroarthropathy, with some studies showing promising results. The condition can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, and early recognition and treatment are essential.

----
[DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS]
Diabetic foot ulcers can be treated with skin replacement therapies, which have been shown to be effective in some cases. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that skin replacement therapies can be a useful treatment option for diabetic foot ulcers. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of these therapies.

----
[SURGICAL ASPECTS OF DIABETIC FOOT]
Surgical aspects of the diabetic foot are an important consideration in the management of diabetic foot ulcers and other complications. A study published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery found that surgical intervention can be an effective treatment option for diabetic foot ulcers and other conditions. The study highlighted the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to diabetic foot care.
----
[ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complication of diabetes, affecting approximately 35-50% of men with diabetes, with prevalence increasing with age. ED in diabetes is primarily caused by endothelial dysfunction and autonomic neuropathy, leading to a failure of nitric oxide (NO)-mediated smooth muscle relaxation. This condition is also an early indicator of endothelial dysfunction and a marker of increased cardiovascular risk. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors are a first-line treatment for ED in diabetes.

----
[PHYSIOLOGY OF ERECTILE FUNCTION]
The physiology of erectile function is a vascular process controlled by the autonomic nervous system, involving the engorgement of erectile tissue in the corpus cavernosum. Smooth muscle relaxation, mediated by nitric oxide (NO), is the key phenomenon in this process, leading to increased arterial inflow and reduced venous outflow. The process is controlled by parasympathetic fibers, with NO being the primary agent responsible for smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum.

----
[SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH DIABETES]
Sexual dysfunction is less common in women with diabetes but can include vaginal dryness and arousal disorder. Contraception and family planning are crucial for women with diabetes, with most currently available methods of contraception being suitable. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be considered for treating menopausal symptoms in women with diabetes on a short-term basis, but it is not justified in asymptomatic women.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Treatment options for erectile dysfunction in diabetes include phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, intracavernosal injection of prostaglandin E (alprostadil), transurethral alprostadil, vacuum therapy, and surgical insertion of penile prostheses. These treatments can be offered by diabetologists and general practitioners, providing effective management for ED in diabetes.
----
[ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Erectile dysfunction (ED) in diabetes is a complex condition that may be contributed to by several potential abnormalities, including impaired endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) responses and increased oxygen-free radical levels. These factors can lead to endothelial dysfunction and reduced vasodilator effect of nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, non-enzymatic glycation of proteins and advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) can also impair endothelium-dependent relaxation and contribute to ED.
----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES IN DIABETES]
Pathophysiologic changes in diabetes, such as non-enzymatic glycation of proteins, can impair endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels, including the aorta in rats. These changes can contribute to the development of ED in men with diabetes. Furthermore, structural changes associated with large vessel disease are commonly associated with ED in diabetes, making it difficult to separate the relative importance of these factors.
----
[OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Other factors, not limited to diabetes, can also contribute to the development of ED in men with diabetes, including hypertension, large-vessel disease, and certain medications such as antihypertensive agents. Men with diabetes are more likely to be taking these medications, which can impair erectile function. Additionally, conditions like autonomic neuropathy can also play a role in the development of ED.
----
[PATHWAYS LEADING TO ERECTILE FUNCTION]
The pathways leading to the relaxation of a corpus cavernosal smooth muscle cell involve the release of nitric oxide (NO) and the subsequent production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In diabetes, defects in NO-mediated smooth-muscle relaxation can occur due to neuropathy of the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) fibers and endothelial dysfunction, leading to ED.
----
[ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common issue in men with diabetes, and its prevalence increases with age. Certain medications, such as beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics, have been reported to be associated with ED. Additionally, there are many other potential causes of ED unrelated to diabetes that can affect men with the condition. 

----
[PREVALENCE OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
The prevalence of complete erectile failure in men with diabetes is significantly higher than in the general population and increases with age. A study found that the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in diabetic men was higher than 15% in those over 70 years, compared to 5% in men in their forties. 

----
[MEDICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Various medications have been associated with erectile dysfunction, including antihypertensives, antidepressants, major tranquillizers, and hormones. A list of specific medications linked to ED includes thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, among others. 

----
[CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Several conditions can contribute to erectile dysfunction, including psychologic disorders, vascular disorders, neurologic disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, and miscellaneous factors such as surgery, trauma, and substance abuse. Diabetes is one of the endocrine and metabolic disorders that can increase the risk of ED.
----
[ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION AND DIABETES]
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complication of diabetes in men, and it may be an early marker of endothelial dysfunction and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Men with type 2 diabetes and ED have approximately double the risk of developing coronary heart disease than those without ED. The association between ED and increased cardiovascular risk may be due to shared underlying factors, such as endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease.

----
[SMOKING AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN ED]
Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing ED, with studies showing that cigarette smoking almost doubles the risk of developing ED after about 7 years. In contrast, moderate alcohol consumption appears to reduce the risk of becoming impotent and may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

----
[QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES IN ED]
ED can significantly worsen a man's quality of life, with symptoms of lowered self-esteem and depression reported in 62% of men, and 40% expressing concern with relationships. Men with diabetes who experience ED often think about it frequently and report that it severely affects their quality of life and relationships.

----
[ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION OF ED IN DIABETES]
Clinical assessment of ED in men with diabetes involves obtaining a description of the nature of the ED and its impact on daily life. The presence of other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, increases the risk of ED. A thorough history and physical examination are essential to diagnose and manage ED effectively.

----
[PREVALENCE OF ED IN DIABETES]
The prevalence of ED in men with diabetes is high, ranging from 25% at age 40-44 years to 70% at age 65-70 years. ED is a common complication of diabetes, affecting approximately 55% of men with diabetes in a general practice population, and is often underreported due to patient anxiety and reluctance to discuss the issue.
----
[DIABETES AND ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Diabetologists can offer effective treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) in patients with diabetes, and it is essential to explain the cause of ED to the patient. Patients should be advised that long-term treatment is often required, as spontaneous return of erectile function in diabetes is rare. Treating ED to save a failing relationship is rarely successful and may worsen the situation.

----
[MANAGING ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Improving poor metabolic control may help general well-being, but it should not be used as a reason to refuse or delay treatment for ED. Patients who smoke should be advised to stop for general health reasons, although stopping smoking may not improve erectile function. Changing medication to improve sexual function is rarely effective and may cause delays and frustration for the patient.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Effective oral therapies, such as phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, have transformed the management of ED and should be offered as first-line therapy to men with diabetes and ED. Other treatment options should be reserved for those in whom oral therapy is contraindicated or ineffective. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors work by enhancing erections under conditions of sexual stimulation.

----
[INVESTIGATING ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Investigations for ED in diabetes are limited, and it is not helpful to try to determine whether ED is psychogenic in origin. Few investigations are needed, but it is worth excluding other treatable causes of ED, such as hypogonadism. The consultation provides an opportunity to address other health issues, including cardiovascular status and diabetes management.

----
[GENERAL ADVICE FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AND ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Most men with diabetes and their partners seeking treatment for impotence require only simple common-sense advice, and specialist psychosexual counseling is not needed for most couples. The consultation provides an opportunity to address the management of the patient's diabetes and other health issues.
----
[DIABETES AND ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION TREATMENT]
The use of PDE 5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil, is effective in treating erectile dysfunction (ED) in men with diabetes, with success rates ranging from 56-59%. However, the presence of significant autonomic neuropathy or endothelial dysfunction may reduce the efficacy of these agents. Despite this, it is worth trying PDE 5 inhibitors in all men with ED unless there is a contraindication. The discontinuation rate from adverse effects has been very low in clinical trials.

----
[CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY OF PDE 5 INHIBITORS]
There is good evidence that PDE 5 inhibitors are not associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and may even reduce blood pressure slightly and improve endothelial function. However, sexual activity can precipitate cardiovascular events in those at risk, and therefore, caution is advised. A retrospective analysis of 36 clinical trials of tadalafil involving over 14,000 men reported no increase in cardiovascular adverse events.

----
[CLINICAL TRIAL DATA FOR PDE 5 INHIBITORS]
Clinical trials have shown that PDE 5 inhibitors are highly effective in treating ED in men with and without diabetes, with success rates ranging from 65-77%. Studies in men with diabetes have reported success rates of 56-59% in the treatment of ED. The long-term efficacy of sildenafil in men with ED has also been reported, with 52% of patients continuing to use it after 2 years.

----
[COMPARISON OF PDE 5 INHIBITORS]
There are currently three PDE 5 inhibitors licensed for the treatment of ED: sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. All three appear to be similar in efficacy and safety, but there are differences in duration of action and adverse effect profiles. Further research is needed to fully compare the effectiveness and safety of these agents in men with diabetes.
----
[ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION TREATMENT IN DIABETIC MEN]
Men with diabetes often require the maximum recommended dose of PDE 5 inhibitors to manage erectile dysfunction (ED), and the drug only works in conjunction with sexual stimulation. A significant proportion of men with diabetes and ED may not respond to PDE 5 inhibitors, and the initial degree of ED is the only significant factor that predicts response to treatment. A trial of PDE 5 inhibitor therapy should not be precluded by any single factor, except for contraindications.
----
[MANAGING NON-RESPONSE TO PDE 5 INHIBITORS]
If men with ED do not respond to PDE 5 inhibitors, hypogonadism should be considered, and treatment with testosterone replacement may improve ED as a sole treatment or enhance the response to PDE 5 inhibitors. It is suggested that men with ED should try at least eight times with a PDE 5 inhibitor at the maximum recommended dose before being considered a non-responder.
----
[OTHER ORAL THERAPIES FOR ED]
Apomorphine, a centrally acting D1/D2 dopamine agonist, has been used to treat ED, but its use is limited due to its potent inducer of nausea, and it is not widely used in diabetic practice. Other oral agents, such as trazodone, yohimbine, and phentolamine, have limited data and are not recommended for treating ED.
----
[CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSESSMENT]
Before treating ED, the issue of cardiovascular safety must be addressed, as the risk of a cardiovascular event is increased after intercourse, especially in men with a history of previous myocardial infarction. A classification scheme can be used to assess cardiovascular risk in men undergoing treatment for ED, and those with the highest risk should be referred for specialist cardiac evaluation.
----
[DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH PDE 5 INHIBITORS]
PDE 5 inhibitors can be used safely in patients taking a wide range of other drugs, but there are several potential important interactions that need to be considered to ensure safe treatment.
----
[LOCAL ADVERSE REACTIONS TO INJECTION THERAPY]
Local adverse reactions, such as penile pain, are relatively common with self-injection therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED) in diabetic patients. Prolonged use of certain medications, like papaverine, may lead to fibrosis in the penis, although this is rare with alprostadil. The combination of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and phentolamine, known as Invicorp, is a potentially useful treatment for ED. 
----
[TRANURETHRAL ALPROSTADIL TREATMENT]
Transurethral administration of alprostadil, also known as MUSE, is a treatment for ED that involves inserting a pellet containing alprostadil into the urethra, allowing the prostaglandin to diffuse into the corpus cavernosum. In studies, 65% of men with ED, including those with diabetes, were able to have intercourse using this system. However, common side effects include penile pain and hypotension. 
----
[VACUUM THERAPY FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION]
Vacuum devices are a non-invasive treatment for ED that use negative pressure to draw blood into the erectile tissue, producing tumescence. The devices consist of a tube and an attached vacuum pump, and require some practice and dexterity to use. A constriction band is used to maintain the erection after the tube is removed. 
----
[INTRAVERNOUS INJECTION THERAPY]
Intracavernosal self-injection therapy involves injecting medication, such as alprostadil, directly into the penis to treat ED. While effective, this treatment has a high long-term discontinuation rate and carries a small risk of priapism, a sustained unwanted erection that must be treated within 6 hours. Patients must be warned of this potential problem and given instructions on what to do if it occurs.
----
[MANAGING ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Erectile dysfunction (ED) in diabetes can be managed by any physician or general practitioner, and it is possible to manage ED in a diabetic clinic with patient information literature available. A general practitioner is more likely to know and understand a patient's particular circumstances, making it easier for men with ED to seek help. Little specialized equipment is required, and interested general practitioners can effectively treat the majority of men presenting with ED.

----
[ADVANTAGES OF PRIMARY CARE FOR ED TREATMENT]
There are considerable advantages for the treatment of ED in general practice, as men with ED may be less intimidated in seeking help from their family practitioner than from a hospital specialist or sexual therapist. General practitioners can manage the problem in a standard consultation with the patient or refer their patients to a fellow partner or colleague with a particular interest in ED.

----
[VACUUM THERAPY FOR ED]
Vacuum devices are safe and effective treatments for ED, with success rates of approximately 70% in men with and without diabetes, provided couples are prepared to use them. However, many couples find the use of vacuum devices unacceptable, and their use has declined since the introduction of newer treatments.

----
[SURGICAL OPTIONS FOR ED]
Surgery has a limited role in the management of ED, but may be considered for men who do not respond to or cannot use other treatments. The surgical options available include the insertion of penile prostheses, corrective surgery for associated Peyronie disease or post-injection corporal fibrosis, and venous and arterial surgery. Counseling of the patient and their partner is extremely important, particularly about the choice of prosthesis.
----
[DIABETES AND FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION]
Women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction, with 27% reporting issues compared to 14% of controls. The most significant difference was reduced lubrication, which may be related to endothelial dysfunction and autonomic neuropathy. However, research suggests that psychologic factors may play a more significant role in female sexual dysfunction than somatic factors.

----
[MECHANISMS OF FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION]
Vaginal dryness and impaired arousal in women with diabetes may be related to failure of NO-mediated smooth muscle relaxation secondary to endothelial dysfunction and autonomic neuropathy. However, there is limited research on the pathophysiology of sexual dysfunction in women, and the relationship between neuropathy and female sexual dysfunction is not well understood.

----
[TREATMENT OF FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION]
PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, have shown conflicting results in improving arousal and vaginal lubrication in non-diabetic women. However, one study found that sildenafil improved arousal and sexual enjoyment in women with diabetes. Topical estrogen or lubricant gels may also be effective in treating vaginal dryness and dyspareunia.

----
[GENITOURINARY INFECTIONS IN WOMEN WITH DIABETES]
Vaginal candidiasis is a common infection in women with diabetes, particularly those with poor blood glucose control. Severe infections can be irritating and painful, interfering with sexual intercourse. Conventional antifungal creams and pessaries are usually effective in treating these infections.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING GENERAL HEALTH ISSUES]
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is often associated with conditions that benefit from early detection, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Addressing lifestyle factors and considering general health issues is crucial in managing ED.

----
[SPECIALIST ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION SERVICES]
Specialist ED services may be necessary for men who have failed to respond to oral therapies. These clinics can provide expertise in alternative treatments, such as intracavernosal injection therapy and vacuum devices, and refer patients to urologic surgeons when necessary.
----
[CONTRACEPTION IN DIABETES]
The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is a widely used method of contraception in women with type 1 diabetes, with the combined OCP used by 17% and the progesterone-only pill (POP) used by 8.6%. However, there is a reluctance to prescribe the combined OCP in women with diabetes due to concerns about safety, despite evidence showing it is simple to use and reliable. Low-dose combined OCPs can be safely used in women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with regular reviews for blood pressure and serum lipids.
----
[SAFETY OF HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION]
Hormonal contraception, including the combined OCP and POP, carries a risk of thromboembolic disease and may affect glucose metabolism, but the evidence suggests these concerns are largely unfounded. Studies have shown that low-dose OCPs have no greater effect on markers of cardiovascular risk in women with diabetes than women without diabetes, and do not increase the risk of microvascular complications or worsen metabolic control.
----
[ALTERNATIVE CONTRACEPTIVE OPTIONS]
Long-acting depot progestin preparations, such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, can be effective in women with diabetes, but may worsen carbohydrate tolerance in some cases. Depot levonorgestrel (Norplant) appears to have minimal effect on carbohydrate tolerance, making it a viable option. The progesterone-only pill is also a suitable alternative, although it may be associated with menstrual irregularities.
----
[FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION]
Women with diabetes may experience sexual dysfunction, including genital infections such as candidiasis, which can be treated with antifungal medications. Improving diabetic control and treating the male partner for candidiasis can help reduce the chances of reinfection. Other genital infections should be referred to a genitourinary service for appropriate treatment.
----
[DIABETES AND HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY]
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may have a beneficial effect on glucose tolerance in women with diabetes, and may even reduce the risk of developing diabetes. However, HRT is not recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction in women with diabetes. Instead, it should be considered for short-term relief of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.
----
[CONTRACEPTION IN DIABETES]
The intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) is a safe and effective form of contraception in women with diabetes, with no increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or failure rate. Other forms of contraception, such as barrier methods and emergency contraception, are also available and can be used by women with diabetes, but may have varying degrees of effectiveness and side effects.
----
[EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION AND DIABETES]
Emergency contraception, including progestogen-only and combined estrogen-progesterone pills, and the copper IUD, can be used by women with diabetes to prevent unplanned pregnancies, which can carry an increased risk of morbidity and fetal abnormalities if glycemic control is poor. However, women with type 1 diabetes should be warned of potential side effects such as nausea and vomiting.
----
[CONTRACEPTIVE ADVICE FOR WOMEN WITH DIABETES]
All women with diabetes of reproductive age should receive good contraceptive advice, as unplanned pregnancies can carry significant risks. Most forms of contraception are safe and effective in women with diabetes, with the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) being the most popular due to its reliability and tolerability.

Hormonal contraception has been found to have a minimal effect on glycometabolic control and lipoprotein metabolism in women with insulin-dependent diabetes. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of hormonal contraception on diabetes management and cardiovascular risk in women with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND GASTROINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS]
Gastrointestinal manifestations are frequent in diabetes, and diabetes can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, leading to symptoms such as dysphagia, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. These manifestations may affect quality of life, impair nutrition, and affect glycemic control. The term diabetic enteropathy refers to all the gastrointestinal complications of diabetes.

----
[PREVALENCE OF GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS IN DIABETES]
Studies suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms are common in diabetes mellitus, but the prevalence may not be substantially higher among people with diabetes compared to matched controls. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in the general population is relatively high, approaching 20%, which may contribute to the similar prevalence among people with and without diabetes.

----
[EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETIC GASTROENTEROPATHY]
The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in diabetes varies across studies, with some studies reporting a higher prevalence of upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, other studies have found that the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms is not significantly different between individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and age-matched controls.

----
[MECHANISMS OF DIABETIC GASTROENTEROPATHY]
Extrinsic and enteric neuropathies are key mechanisms in diabetic gastroenteropathy, and motor dysfunctions may affect any region of the gastrointestinal tract, causing fast or slow transit. Glycemia influences the development of neuropathy and acutely changes gastric emptying, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC GASTROENTEROPATHY]
Assessments of hydration, nutrition, and metabolic status are essential in managing diabetic gastroenteropathy. Measurements of regional transit and anorectal motor and sensory functions are key to management, and treatment should focus on correcting hydration, nutrition, and metabolic status, excluding iatrogenic factors, and addressing the underlying pathophysiologic process.
----
[GI MOTOR FUNCTION]
Gastrointestinal motor function is primarily controlled by the intrinsic or enteric nervous system and modulated by the extrinsic nervous system, which includes the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The enteric nervous system consists of 100 million neurons that are organized in distinct ganglionated plexi, including the submucous plexus and the myenteric plexus. The interstitial cells of Cajal serve as pacemakers and convey messages from nerve to smooth muscle. In diabetes, derangements of the extrinsic nerves can alter gastrointestinal motility and secretion.
----
[DIABETIC GASTROPARESIS]
Diabetic gastroparesis may cause severe symptoms, resulting in nutritional compromise, impaired glucose control, and a poor quality of life. Studies have shown that gastric emptying and its symptoms are generally stable during long-term follow-up, but overall survival is significantly lower than expected in patients with gastroparesis. The most common causes of death in these patients are cardiovascular disease, respiratory failure, and malignancy.
----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF GI DYSMOTILITY]
Gastrointestinal dysmotility in diabetes is caused by extrinsic neural dysfunction, hyperglycemia, and hormonal disturbances, as well as intrinsic neuronal dysfunctions resulting from loss of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and interstitial cells of Cajal. Neural dysfunction has been attributed to several mechanisms, including oxidative stress. The enteric nervous system, also known as the "little brain" in the digestive tract, plays a crucial role in regulating gastrointestinal motility.
----
[CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS]
Diabetic gastroparesis can have significant clinical implications, including impaired glucose control, nutritional compromise, and decreased quality of life. Understanding the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal dysmotility in diabetes is essential for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Early recognition and management of gastroparesis are critical to preventing long-term complications and improving survival.
----
[DIABETES AND GASTRIC EMPTYING]
Gastric emptying is the process by which the stomach empties its contents into the small intestine for further digestion and absorption. In people with diabetes, gastric emptying can be affected, leading to delayed or accelerated emptying. Normally, solids are emptied in an exponential manner, with an initial lag phase followed by a more rapid, linear emptying, while liquids are emptied in a linear manner.

----
[GASTRIC EMPTYING RATES]
The rate of gastric emptying can vary, but normally, approximately 50% of solids are emptied in 2 hours and 100% in 4 hours. Liquids, on the other hand, are emptied at a faster rate, with the head of the column of liquid chyme reaching the cecum as early as 30 minutes after ingestion. In people with diabetes, these rates can be altered, leading to digestive complications.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR GASTRIC EMPTYING]
Diagnostic tools such as scintigraphy and manometry can be used to assess gastric emptying and gastric motor functions in people with diabetes. These tools can help identify delayed or accelerated gastric emptying, which can inform treatment and management of diabetes-related digestive complications. Scintigraphy, for example, can measure the post-prandial change in gastric volume, while manometry can demonstrate the contraction of the distal antrum and pylorus.
----
[DIABETES AND GASTROINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS]
Diabetes can cause various gastrointestinal manifestations, including accelerated or delayed gastric emptying, increased and reduced gastric sensation, and impaired gastric accommodation. These issues can be attributed to a vagal neuropathy, which may cause antral hypomotility and/or pylorospasm. The pathophysiology of rapid gastric emptying in diabetes is less well understood, but it may be related to impaired gastric accommodation resulting from a vagal neuropathy.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETIC ENTEROPATHY]
The pathophysiology of diabetic enteropathy involves extrinsic neural dysfunction, which can lead to a loss of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers without significant neuronal loss. This loss of nerve fibers can be multifocal, suggesting ischemic injury, and can result in reduced neuronal staining and loss of inhibitory neurons expressing nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The reduction in nitrergic inhibitory functions may contribute to impaired gastric accommodation and accelerated intestinal transit in diabetes.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY AND GASTROINTESTINAL FUNCTION]
Insulin therapy can improve glycemic control and restore expression of NOS and gastric emptying in animal models of diabetes. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors can also prevent the loss of intestinal cells of Cajal (ICC) in cultures, which is important for maintaining normal gut motility. The effects of insulin on ICC are likely mediated by smooth muscle secretion of stem cell factor, rather than directly by insulin and insulin-like growth factors.

----
[DIABETIC ENTEROPATHY MECHANISMS]
Several mechanisms, including apoptosis, oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products, and neuroimmune mechanisms, may be responsible for neuronal loss and gut dysmotility in diabetes. The loss of ICC has been attributed to a reduction in heme-oxygenase (HO-1) and other protective mechanisms against oxidative stress. Understanding these mechanisms is important for developing effective treatments for diabetic enteropathy.

----
[DIABETES-RELATED GASTROINTESTINAL CONDITIONS]
Diabetes is associated with various gastrointestinal conditions, including gastroparesis, small bowel dysmotility, gallstones, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. These conditions can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and can significantly impact the quality of life of individuals with diabetes. Early recognition and treatment of these conditions are essential for preventing complications and improving outcomes.
----
[DIABETIC GASTROPARESIS AND DYSMOTILITY]
Diabetic gastroparesis and dysmotility can be caused by various factors, including iatrogenic effects from treatment with amylin or GLP-1 analogs, as well as sympathetic fiber involvement and artificial sweeteners. These conditions can lead to accelerated small intestinal transit, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with rapid ileal transit may experience bile acid malabsorption, which can induce colonic secretion and worsen symptoms.

----
[DIABETIC DIARRHEA]
Diabetic diarrhea can be categorized into conditions associated with malabsorption and those that are not. Malabsorption-related diarrhea may be caused by bacterial overgrowth, small bowel mucosal disease, or pancreatic insufficiency. Features such as anemia, macrocytosis, or steatorrhea can indicate malabsorption and prompt further investigation. Small intestinal dysmotility can also contribute to bacterial overgrowth and diarrhea.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA AND GASTRIC EMPTYING]
Acute hyperglycemia can delay gastric emptying in healthy subjects and those with type 1 diabetes. This effect is thought to be caused by hyperglycemia-induced suppression of antral motility and migrating motor activity. However, the impact of strict glycemic control on gastric emptying is unclear, and improved glycemic control may not necessarily improve gastric emptying.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH]
The diagnostic approach to diabetic gastrointestinal symptoms includes history and examination, incontinence assessment, artificial sweetener use, and features of malabsorption. Dietary modification, anorectal manometry, and rectal sensation testing may also be used. Small bowel aspirate, biopsy, and pancreatic function tests can help identify underlying causes such as bacterial overgrowth or pancreatic insufficiency.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Treatment options for diabetic gastrointestinal symptoms include supplementing enzymes, treating sprue or bacterial overgrowth, and empiric trials of medications such as loperamide, clonidine, or octreotide. Biofeedback and other therapies may also be used to address underlying causes such as sympathetic or pudendal neuropathy.
----
[DIABETES GASTROINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS]
Gastrointestinal manifestations of diabetes can include esophageal peristaltic disturbances, dyspepsia, and gastroparesis, which is characterized by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and impaired nutrition due to delayed gastric emptying. Patients with diabetic gastroparesis often have long-standing type 1 diabetes with other microvascular complications. The term gastroparesis should be restricted to patients with markedly delayed gastric emptying, while diabetic dyspepsia is a more appropriate term for those with less severe delays.

----
[DIABETES-RELATED GASTROPARESIS SYMPTOMS]
Symptoms of gastroparesis in diabetes include nausea, vomiting, early satiation after meals, and impaired nutrition, which can lead to hypoglycemia due to insufficient food absorption to match the effects of exogenous insulin. Nausea and vomiting often occur in episodes lasting days to months or in cycles, and can be associated with impaired glycemic control. Diabetic dyspepsia, on the other hand, is characterized by post-prandial upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating, fullness, and upper abdominal pain.

----
[DIABETES-RELATED FECAL INCONTINENCE]
Fecal incontinence in diabetic patients can be caused by loose stools and anorectal dysfunctions, with patients having a higher threshold for rectal perception of balloon distention, indicating reduced sensation. Sympathetic and pudendal neuropathies can also impair internal anal sphincter function and anal resting pressures, contributing to fecal incontinence. These complications can have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with diabetes.

----
[DIABETIC GASTROPARESIS DIAGNOSIS]
The diagnosis of diabetic gastroparesis can be challenging, as symptoms are of limited utility for predicting delayed gastric emptying. Clinicians often rely on manifestations such as vomiting of undigested food eaten several hours previously, weight loss, and signs of autonomic neuropathy to predict delayed gastric emptying. However, gastric emptying studies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of delayed gastric emptying.
----
[DIABETES-RELATED GASTROPARESIS]
Gastroparesis is a complication of diabetes that can cause gastric outlet obstruction, and its symptoms may be similar to those of cardiac, biliary, or pancreatic disease. Metabolic derangements, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, and certain medications can contribute to dysmotility. Gastric emptying of solids can be quantified by scintigraphy, and antroduodenal manometry can help confirm the motor disturbance. This can facilitate the selection of patients for enteral feeding.

----
[DIABETIC DIARRHEA]
Diabetic diarrhea is a chronic condition characterized by unexplained diarrhea associated with severe diabetes, and it can be severe and episodic. It may occur at any time, often nocturnal, and can be associated with anal incontinence. Diabetic diarrhea was first described in 1936, and its exact causes are still not fully understood. It is a significant complication of diabetes that can affect patients' quality of life.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH]
In patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is necessary to exclude peptic ulcer disease and other conditions. Barium X-rays of the small intestine or enterography with computed tomography may be considered when the clinical features raise the possibility of small intestinal obstruction. Gastric emptying studies and antroduodenal manometry can help diagnose and manage gastroparesis and other motility disorders.

----
[AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Autonomic dysfunction can occur in patients with diabetes, affecting various systems, including the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms and signs of autonomic dysfunction can include orthostatic hypotension, fixed dilated pupils, and decreased gut motility. Table 46.1 lists the symptoms and signs of autonomic dysfunction, which can be useful in diagnosing and managing patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES-RELATED GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS]
Patients with diabetes may experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. These symptoms can be related to delayed gastric emptying, internal anal sphincter dysfunction, or other underlying conditions. It is essential to characterize symptoms accurately, as many people have misconceptions about normal bowel habits. A normal range of bowel movements can vary from three per week to three per day.

----
[CONSTIPATION IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
Constipation in diabetes patients can manifest as infrequent stools, hard stools, excessive straining during defecation, or a sense of incomplete evacuation after defecation. A careful rectal examination is necessary to exclude rectal mucosal lesions and detect rectal prolapse or disordered defecation. The examination can also suggest features of defecatory disorders, such as reduced or increased perineal descent and paradoxical contraction of the puborectalis muscle.

----
[ABDOMINAL PAIN IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
Diabetes patients are susceptible to abdominal pain from various causes, including gallstones, mesenteric ischemia, and thoracolumbar radiculopathy. A careful history is essential to diagnose the underlying cause of abdominal pain, and specific tests may be indicated based on clinical features. Altered gallbladder contractility may not cause symptoms in the absence of gallstones.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS]
Diagnostic testing for gastrointestinal symptoms in diabetes patients is guided by symptom pattern and severity. Gastric emptying assessments, such as scintigraphy or barium studies, can help diagnose delayed gastric emptying, which can be asymptomatic. Autonomic function testing and intraluminal techniques, such as manometry, may also be useful in characterizing motor dysfunctions and guiding therapy. A radiolabel test that tags the solid phase of a meal can accurately assess solid emptying and distinguish normal function from delayed gastric emptying.
----
[DIAGNOSING SMALL INTESTINAL OVERGROWTH]
Small intestinal overgrowth can be diagnosed using the lactulose hydrogen breath test or the glucose breath test, although these tests have limited sensitivity and specificity. The lactulose hydrogen breath test has a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 44%, while the glucose breath test has a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 83%. An early hydrogen peak may be seen at least 15 minutes before the later prolonged peak, which corresponds to the passage of the remaining lactulose into the colon.
----
[MANAGEMENT OF SMALL INTESTINAL OVERGROWTH]
The management of small intestinal overgrowth involves addressing fluid and nutritional requirements, improving glycemic control, and treating symptoms. Assessment of stool fat can help differentiate between diabetic diarrhea and other causes of diarrhea, and an upper endoscopy can provide an opportunity to obtain duodenal aspirates for bacterial overgrowth and small bowel biopsy to exclude celiac disease.
----
[AUTONOMIC TESTS FOR DIABETES]
Autonomic tests can be used to assess the function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in patients with diabetes. These tests include the thermoregulatory sweat test, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test, heart rate and blood pressure responses, and plasma norepinephrine response to postural changes. Each test has its own rationale, comments, and pitfalls, and can help diagnose and manage autonomic dysfunction in patients with diabetes.
----
[SYMPATHETIC FUNCTION TESTS]
Sympathetic function tests include the thermoregulatory sweat test, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test, heart rate and blood pressure responses, and plasma norepinephrine response to postural changes. These tests can help assess the function of the sympathetic nervous system, which can be impaired in patients with diabetes.
----
[PARASYMPATHETIC FUNCTION TESTS]
Parasympathetic function tests include heart rate variation with deep breathing, supine/erect heart rate, and Valsalva ratio. These tests can help assess the function of the parasympathetic nervous system, which can be impaired in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES-RELATED GASTROPARESIS TREATMENT]
Gastroparesis in diabetes patients can be treated with prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide, which enhances gastric emptying of liquids, but its long-term use is limited due to declining efficacy and central nervous system side effects. The preferred dosage is 10 mg t.i.d., administered 30 minutes before meals, for a short duration. Other treatments, such as domperidone and botulinum toxin injection, have limited evidence to support their use. 
----
[MANAGING SEVERE GASTROPARESIS]
Patients with severe gastroparesis may require hospitalization for measures such as intravenous hydration, correction of metabolic derangements, nasoenteric decompression, and enteral nutrition to manage vomiting and nutritional requirements. Parenteral nutrition may be necessary in cases of malnutrition, and erythromycin can be used to accelerate gastric emptying. 
----
[GASTROPARESIS NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT]
For patients with gastroparesis, liquid or blenderized food is better tolerated than solids, and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential. A jejunal feeding tube may be necessary for patients who do not respond to other measures, and this procedure should be preceded by a trial of nasojejunal feeding. 
----
[ERYTHROMYCIN TREATMENT FOR GASTROPARESIS]
Erythromycin can accelerate gastric emptying in patients with gastroparesis, but its prokinetic effects are limited by tachyphylaxis. Anecdotal findings suggest that erythromycin may be effective if courses are separated by a drug-free period. However, hyperglycemia can interfere with the prokinetic effect of intravenous erythromycin on gastric emptying.
----
[DIABETIC CONSTIPATION TREATMENT]
Lubiprostone can be considered for patients with diabetes and constipation who have not responded to osmotic agents, as it has been shown to improve symptoms in functional constipation in healthy subjects. Although there are no specific studies on patients with diabetes and constipation, lubiprostone may be a viable treatment option. Further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in this population.

----
[DIABETIC GASTROPARESIS]
Gastroparesis is a complication of diabetes that can cause delayed gastric emptying, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating. The prevalence of gastroparesis in patients with diabetes is significant, and it can have a significant impact on health-related quality of life. Treatment options for gastroparesis are limited, and electrical stimulation devices have shown mixed results, with some studies suggesting a placebo response.

----
[DIABETIC DIARRHEA TREATMENT]
Diabetic diarrhea can be treated symptomatically with loperamide, which is preferably administered 30 minutes before meals. This treatment approach can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for patients with diabetes and diarrhea. However, the underlying causes of diabetic diarrhea, such as autonomic neuropathy, must also be addressed to effectively manage the condition.

----
[DIABETIC GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS]
Gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation, diarrhea, and gastroparesis, are common in patients with diabetes. These symptoms can have a significant impact on health-related quality of life and can be challenging to manage.

Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of using lubiprostone in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND SKIN CONDITIONS]
Various skin conditions are associated with diabetes, either type 1 or type 2, and can be caused by the metabolic changes in diabetes, endocrine disorders, or chronic complications of the disease. These conditions can include necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, diabetic dermopathy, and acanthosis nigricans. The skin is also thickened in diabetes, and irreversible glycation of skin collagen and other proteins may lead to yellowish skin discoloration.

----
[SKIN DISORDERS IN DIABETES]
Diabetic dermopathy, also known as "shin spots," is the most common skin disorder in patients with diabetes, usually occurring in the pre-tibial region in long-standing diabetes. Other skin disorders associated with diabetes include erythema, calciphylaxis, and candidal overgrowth. Bacterial infections, such as "malignant" otitis externa, can be potentially lethal in people with poorly controlled diabetes.

----
[SKIN INFECTIONS AND DIABETES]
Skin infections are more common in people with poorly controlled diabetes, but are not specific to the condition. Examples of skin infections that can occur in people with diabetes include candidal overgrowth, bacterial infections, and erythrasma. Dermatophytosis, on the other hand, is not found more frequently in those with diabetes than in those without the disease.

----
[CUTANEOUS SIDE EFFECTS OF DIABETES TREATMENTS]
Insulin injections can cause both lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy, while allergic insulin reactions can be subdivided into immediate-local, general, delayed, or biphasic responses. Sulfonlyureas are also well-recognized causes of multiple cutaneous drug reactions. However, with the availability of purer insulin, allergic insulin reactions are now rare.

----
[METABOLIC MANIFESTATIONS OF DIABETES]
The metabolic manifestations of diabetes can include a number of cutaneous conditions, such as diabetic thick skin and necrobiosis lipoidica. These conditions may be related to the process of non-enzymatic glycation of cutaneous structural proteins, particularly collagens or changes in microvascular structural proteins. However, the cause of many of these conditions remains obscure, and some previously thought associations have not been substantiated by subsequent studies.

[NECROBIOSIS LIPOIDICA DIABETICORUM PREVALENCE]
Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is a rare condition with a prevalence of 0.3% in diabetic populations. It is more common in individuals with diabetes than those without, although the relationship to diabetes and its etiology remains unclear. Women are three times more commonly affected than men, and NLD usually develops in young adult or early middle life. 

----
[DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH NLD]
Patients with diabetes and NLD appear to have a higher incidence of chronic diabetic complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and microalbuminuria. This suggests that microangiopathy may have an etiologic role in the development of NLD. The presence of immunologic deposits in lesional vessel walls also implicates immune factors in the pathogenesis of NLD. 

----
[CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NLD]
NLD has a distinctive appearance, with early lesions often presenting as rounded, dull red, symptomless papules or plaques. Over time, these lesions can progress to a yellow atrophic appearance with telangiectasia. The condition can occasionally be reported in childhood, but it is more commonly seen in young adults or early middle-aged individuals. 

----
[DIABETES-RELATED SKIN CONDITIONS]
Other cutaneous metabolic manifestations associated with diabetes include diabetic dermopathy, diabetic bullae, diabetic thick skin, acanthosis nigricans, and eruptive xanthoma. These conditions can have distinct clinical characteristics and may be related to various aspects of diabetes, such as insulin resistance or glycemic control.
----
[Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum (NLD) Treatment]
Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum (NLD) is a complication of diabetes with no proven effective treatment in double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Good diabetic control does not usually have a significant effect on the course of the condition, but patients should be encouraged not to smoke and avoid trauma to the area. Corticosteroids, either applied topically or by intralesional injection, may be beneficial for early NLD lesions, while topical retinoids may be beneficial in atrophic cases.

----
[Diabetic Dermopathy Overview]
Diabetic dermopathy, also known as shin spots, is the most common dermatologic condition associated with diabetes, occurring in up to 50% of patients with diabetes. It is also found in up to 3% of adults without diabetes, but those without diabetes usually have only one or two lesions. The condition is more prevalent in men, patients over 50 years of age, and those with long-standing diabetes.

----
[NLD Clinical Characteristics]
Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum (NLD) often presents as an oval or irregularly shaped, indurated plaque with central atrophy, and may have a shiny surface with prominent telangiectatic vessels. The margin of lesions may be brownish or red, and sometimes with comedo-like plaques. The condition can slowly progress to a chronic lesion, and spontaneous remission is unusual.

----
[Diabetic Dermopathy Associations]
Diabetic dermopathy is associated with microvascular changes, including thickening of arterioles and capillaries, and is a subtle sign that suggests more serious complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and coronary artery disease. The presence of diabetic dermopathy may indicate a higher risk of these complications.

----
[NLD Treatment Options]
Various treatments have been tried for NLD, including oral steroids, thiazolidinediones, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents, but controlled trials have not shown any of these to be effective. Topical PUVA, non-steroidal systemic immunosuppression, and pulsed dye laser treatment may be beneficial in some cases, but more experience is required to confirm their effectiveness.
----
[DIABETIC DERMOPATHY]
Diabetic dermopathy, also known as "shin spots," is a skin condition characterized by well-circumscribed atrophic brownish scars, often on the shins, forearms, thighs, and bony prominences. The lesions are usually bilateral and may appear in crops, with early lesions being oval red papules that slowly develop scaling and a brown color. There is no effective treatment, but the lesions tend to resolve over 1-2 years.

----
[DIABETIC BULLAE]
Diabetic bullae, also known as bullosis diabeticorum, is a rare condition that affects men more than women, and is more common in older patients and those with peripheral neuropathy. The condition presents as tense blisters on a non-inflammatory base, appearing rapidly and healing over a few weeks without scarring. The feet and lower legs are the most common sites, followed by the hands.

----
[DIABETIC THICK SKIN]
The skin of patients with diabetes is measurably thicker than in subjects without diabetes, due to the thickening and disorganization of collagen bundles in the dermis. This is caused by irreversible non-enzymatic glycation, cross-linking, and "browning" of protein, which damages the protein and reduces the ability of enzymes to remodel the collagen fibers. This can lead to yellow skin discoloration, loss of elasticity, and potentially, diabetic hand syndrome and diabetic scleredema.

----
[DIABETIC HAND SYNDROME]
Diabetic hand syndrome is a condition that affects up to 75% of subjects with diabetes over 60 years of age, characterized by thick, tight, waxy skin and limited joint mobility. The incidence is not closely related to the duration of disease or metabolic control, and the combination of thick skin and limited joint mobility is known as cheiroarthropathy, present in 30-40% of patients with type 1 diabetes.
----
[SKIN CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES]
Dermal thickening and conditions such as scleredema and acanthosis nigricans can occur in individuals with diabetes. Scleredema is characterized by dermal thickening with large collagen bundles and an increased number of mast cells, and may respond to ultraviolet light treatment. Acanthosis nigricans is a rare condition marked by a velvety papillomatous overgrowth of the epidermis, often associated with internal malignancy or endocrine disorders.

----
[ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS CHARACTERISTICS]
Acanthosis nigricans is typically found in the flexural areas, such as the axilla, inguinal region, and neck, and is characterized by a dark, velvety appearance due to extensive folding and thickening of the epidermis and increased numbers of melanocytes. In rare cases, it can involve the knuckles and other extensor surfaces, with verrucous patches and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. Severe and widespread acanthosis nigricans is often associated with internal malignancy.

----
[SKIN THICKENING AND LIMITED JOINT MOBILITY]
Skin thickening can also lead to limited joint mobility, particularly in the hands and fingers, with symptoms including thickening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and digits, painful stiff fingers, and potentially fixed flexion deformity of the fingers and Dupuytren contracture. In some cases, soft tissue thickening of the wrist can cause carpal tunnel syndrome by compressing the median nerve.

----
[SCLEREDEMA OF DIABETES]
Scleredema of diabetes is a condition marked by dermal thickening, commonly involving the posterior aspect of the neck and upper parts of the back, and extending to the face, arms, and abdomen in more severe cases. It has a prevalence of 2.5% in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly in those who are overweight and have poorly controlled diabetes.
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HYPERINSULINEMIA]
Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia can lead to various skin conditions, including acanthosis nigricans and eruptive xanthomas. Hyperinsulinemia can activate insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors, causing excessive epidermal growth. This can result in skin conditions such as acanthosis nigricans, which is characterized by epidermal overgrowth. 

----
[ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS]
Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition that can be caused by hyperinsulinemia, leading to epidermal overgrowth. It can be disfiguring and upsetting for patients, but mild peeling agents such as 5% salicylic acid may be helpful in managing the condition. The condition usually partially regresses if hyperinsulinemia can be successfully reduced.

----
[ERUPTIVE XANTHOMAS]
Eruptive xanthomas are small, red or yellow nodules that can occur on the skin, particularly on the extensor surfaces of the limbs and buttocks. They are caused by hypertriglyceridemia, which can occur in diabetes, especially if poorly controlled. Lesions usually regress slowly within months after hypertriglyceridemia has been corrected by lipid-lowering drugs or improved glycemic control.

----
[TREATMENT OF SKIN CONDITIONS]
Treatment of skin conditions such as acanthosis nigricans and eruptive xanthomas often involves addressing the underlying cause, such as hyperinsulinemia or hypertriglyceridemia. Reducing insulin resistance and improving glycemic control can help manage these conditions, and lipid-lowering drugs may also be used to correct hypertriglyceridemia.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS - CALCIPHYLAXIS]
Calciphylaxis is a small-vessel vasculopathy that can occur in patients with diabetes, particularly those with renal failure. It is characterized by mural calcification, intimal proliferation, fibrosis, and thrombosis, leading to ischemic skin lesions and poorly healing ulcers. Aggressive analgesic treatment, optimal blood glucose control, and weight reduction are essential for managing calciphylaxis. The prognosis is poor due to impaired wound healing and infection leading to sepsis.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS - MACROVASCULAR CHANGES]
Patients with diabetes are prone to developing non-healing ulcers, particularly those with venous insufficiency and arterial disease. Cutaneous signs of ischemia in the lower limbs include cold or cyanosed feet, erythema, hair loss, and atrophy. Large-vessel disease is more common in patients with diabetes, and a sign of this is dependent rubor with delayed return of color after pressure has been applied to the skin.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS - INFECTIONS]
Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infection in patients with diabetes by causing abnormal microcirculation, decreased phagocytosis, impaired leukocyte adherence, and delayed chemotaxis. However, studies have shown that there is no significant increase in the prevalence of cutaneous infections in most subjects with diabetes. Infections can occur at presentation or with poor glycemic control, and are listed in Table 47.3.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS - VASCULAR CHANGES]
Chronic diabetic complications can affect both small and large vessels, leading to various skin conditions. Facial erythema, such as rubeosis faciei, can occur in people with diabetes due to altered vascular tone or diabetic microangiopathy. Periungual telangiectasia, characterized by erythema of the skin surrounding the nail bed, is an excellent marker of functional microangiopathy and can occur in up to 49% of patients with diabetes.
----
[SKIN INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Bacterial infections, such as furuncles, carbuncles, and erythrasma, are more common in people with diabetes, particularly those with poorly controlled diabetes. Increased rates of colonization with Staphylococcus aureus have been reported in individuals with diabetes. Severe infections, such as malignant otitis externa, can occur in elderly patients with diabetes and can be potentially lethal. 
----
[UNCOMMON INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Unusual infections with coliforms or anaerobes can occur in people with diabetes, as well as Pseudomonas infections of the toe web spaces or nailfold. Anaerobic cellulitis with Clostridium species can occur in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, requiring aggressive treatment. Necrotizing fasciitis, a potentially lethal skin and soft tissue infection, is more common in those with diabetes.
----
[CANDIDA INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Infection with Candida albicans can be a presenting feature of diabetes or a complication of poorly controlled diabetes. Candida infections can appear as erythematous papules with satellite pustules and can affect various areas of the body, including the flexural areas, vulva, penis, and nail margins. Vulvovaginitis is the most common manifestation in women, while candidal balanitis and balanoposthitis occur less commonly in men.
----
[ORAL AND OTHER CANDIDA INFECTIONS]
Candidal angular stomatitis, atrophic tongue, and oral candidiasis are oral manifestations of diabetes. Candidal intertrigo can occur on opposing surfaces under the breast, in the groins and axillae, or in the folds of the abdominal skin. Candida infection of the hands and feet can be more severe in people with diabetes, presenting as chronic paronychia with swelling and erythema around the lateral nailfold.
----
[DIABETES-RELATED SKIN CONDITIONS]
Patients with diabetes can experience various skin conditions, including vitiligo, which is an autoimmune condition that causes patchy symmetrical depigmented areas of skin, leading to significant emotional distress. Treatment options include topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Patients should also practice photoprotection and use high-factor sunscreen or cover the affected area.

----
[lichen PLANUS AND DIABETES]
Lichen planus is an inflammatory disorder of the skin that has been reported to have an increased incidence in patients with diabetes, particularly the erosive oral lichen planus variant. However, the link between diabetes and lichen planus is still unproven, as both conditions are relatively common.

----
[DERMATOPHYTOSIS IN DIABETES]
Dermatophyte infections are not more common in people with diabetes than in the general population, but they can serve as a portal of entry for other infectious agents, particularly in those with neurovascular complications. Treatment options include topical imidazole antifungal agents or systemic terbinafine, itraconazole, or griseofulvin.

----
[PHYCOMYCETE INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Poor metabolic control in diabetes can lead to phycomycete infections, which can be life-threatening. Deep phycomycete infections, such as rhinocerebral mucormycosis, can manifest as fever, facial cellulitis, and periorbital edema, and require aggressive treatment, including correction of acid-base imbalance, debridement of devitalized tissue, and intravenous antifungal therapy.

----
[ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS AND DIABETES]
Certain conditions, such as vitiligo, are more common in people with diabetes. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition that can occur in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and is characterized by patchy depigmented areas of skin. It can be associated with other endocrine conditions, such as polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2.
----
[PRURITUS IN DIABETES]
Pruritus, or itching, is not a direct symptom of diabetes, and studies have failed to link generalized pruritus with diabetes. However, localized itching, particularly in the genital area, can be associated with Candida infections, which are more common in patients with diabetes. Xerotic skin, a feature present in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, can also predispose to pruritus.
----
[YELLOW NAILS AS A DIABETIC MARKER]
Yellow nails have been frequently noted in patients with diabetes, particularly on the distal hallux. The presence of a yellowish or brownish discoloration on the nail plate can be an early sign of diabetes. Yellowish nails are also seen in association with onychomycosis, psoriasis, and in the elderly, but in diabetic patients, they may be a marker of non-enzymatic glycosylation.
----
[CLEAR CELL SYRINGOMAS AND DIABETES]
Clear cell syringomas are an unusual variant of adnexal non-neoplastic lesions that are derived from intra-epidermal parts of the sweat duct. They are clinically undistinguishable from typical syringomas and are often found in patients with diabetes. The clear cell variety has been postulated to be related to phosphorylase deficiency secondary to elevated glucose levels.
----
[GLUCAGONOMA SYNDROME]
The glucagonoma syndrome is a rare condition caused by tumors of the α cells of the pancreas that secrete glucagon. It is characterized by four major components: increased glucagon levels, diabetes, weight loss, and a pathognomonic rash of necrolytic migratory erythema. The rash is a distinctive feature of the syndrome and can occur up to 6 years before the diagnosis of glucagonoma is made.
----
[NECROLYTIC MIGRATORY ERYTHEMA]
Necrolytic migratory erythema is a skin eruption that occurs in 70% of patients with glucagonoma syndrome. It manifests as an annular erythematous and figurate rash with a migrating active edge, and can be a presenting sign of the syndrome. The rash can be associated with other physical findings, including glossitis, stomatitis, brittle dystrophic nails, and alopecia.
----
[LIPOHYPERTROPHY]
Lipohypertrophy is a condition that presents as soft subcutaneous nodules or thickening at sites of repeated insulin injections, caused by the lipogenic action of insulin. This can lead to delayed insulin absorption and disruption of glycemic control. It can be resolved by changing the site of insulin injections. Hyperkeratotic verrucous variants of lipohypertrophy have also been described.

----
[INSULIN ALLERGY]
Insulin allergy is a rare condition, occurring in less than 1% of insulin-treated patients, due to the use of recombinant human and analog insulin. Allergic reactions to insulin can be classified as immediate-local, general, delayed, or biphasic, and can range from localized erythema and urticaria to generalized urticaria and anaphylaxis. Treatment of immediate-local reactions involves changing to a more purified insulin product.

----
[LIPOATROPHY]
Lipoatrophy is a condition that occurs at sites of insulin injections, characterized by a loss of subcutaneous fat, and can be a cosmetic concern. It is less common with the use of purer insulins and is more common in young female subjects with diabetes. The pathogenesis is secondary to an immunologic reaction, and circumscribed depressed areas of skin can be seen at sites of insulin injections 6-24 months after the start of treatment.

----
[PERFORATING DERMATOSES]
Perforating dermatoses is a condition associated with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, particularly in African-American patients on dialysis, characterized by pruritic hyperkeratotic papules on the extensor surfaces of the lower limbs. The lesions can occur at sites of trauma and are thought to be a disorder of keratinization. Treatment options include topical steroids, retinoids, and phototherapy.
----
[INSULIN ALLERGIC REACTIONS]
Insulin allergic reactions may be managed by antihistamines, addition of glucocorticoids, discontinuation of therapy, or a change in the insulin delivery system. Cutaneous complications of insulin therapy can include infections, granulomatous lesions, and localized pigmentation. Patients using insulin pumps can experience local infections, contact allergy, and subcutaneous nodules. Retention of fluid can also occur when insulin therapy is first commenced, manifested as edema of the legs.

----
[SKIN REACTIONS TO ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS]
Sulfonylureas are the most common oral hypoglycemic agents that cause skin reactions, with about 1-5% of patients developing cutaneous reactions within 2 months of treatment. Common reactions include maculopapular, morbilliform, urticarial, or generalized erythematous reactions, which resolve with discontinuation of the medication. More severe reactions, such as erythema multiforme and extensive blistering, can also occur. Photosensitive reactions and lichenoid eruptions have also been reported.

----
[CHLORPROPAMIDE ALCOHOL FLUSH]
The chlorpropamide alcohol flush is a disulfiram-like effect that occurs in 10-30% of patients taking this drug. Patients experience facial erythema, headache, and palpitations about 15 minutes after drinking alcohol, which subsides in about an hour. This reaction is a notable side effect of chlorpropamide, a type of oral hypoglycemic agent. It is essential for patients to be aware of this potential reaction to avoid unnecessary distress.
----
[NECROBIOSIS LIPOIDICA TREATMENT]
Necrobiosis lipoidica is a skin condition that can be treated with various methods, including topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and other medications such as clobetasol propionate, tretinoin, and pioglitazone. Additionally, treatments like pentoxifylline, nicotinamide, and cyclosporine have been used to effectively manage the condition.

This includes regular skin exams, proper wound care, and education on foot care and prevention of infections.
----
[DIABETES-RELATED SKIN CONDITIONS]
Diabetes can cause various skin conditions, including lipohypertrophy, which is a thickening of the skin due to repeated insulin injections, and can delay insulin absorption. Other skin conditions associated with diabetes include acanthosis nigricans, cutaneous insulin reactions, and human insulin allergy. These conditions can be caused by insulin therapy or other factors related to diabetes.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY COMPLICATIONS]
Insulin therapy can cause several complications, including localized skin reactions, such as lipodystrophies and granulomas, which can be caused by the insulin itself or by additives like zinc. These reactions can be painful and may affect the absorption of insulin. In some cases, insulin therapy can also cause more severe reactions, such as erythema multiforme or lichenoid eruptions.

----
[ORAL MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS]
Oral medications used to treat diabetes, such as sulfonylureas and metformin, can cause skin reactions, including lichenoid eruptions, erythema multiforme, and leucocytoclastic vasculitis. These reactions are rare but can be severe and may require discontinuation of the medication. It is essential to monitor patients for these potential side effects and adjust treatment accordingly.

----
[DIABETES-RELATED DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS]
Diabetes is associated with several dermatological conditions, including pruritus, ichthyosis, and clear-cell syringoma. These conditions can be caused by diabetes itself or by related factors, such as poor glucose control or nerve damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is essential to improve the quality of life for people with diabetes.

----
[GLUCAGONOMA SYNDROME]
Glucagonoma syndrome is a rare condition associated with diabetes, characterized by a glucagon-producing tumor, which can cause skin rash, weight loss, and diabetes. This condition is often underdiagnosed and requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent complications.
----
[DIABETES AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS]
Musculoskeletal disorders, such as limited joint mobility and fibroproliferative disorders, are more common in people with diabetes and can lead to pain, functional impairment, and disability. These disorders can also affect the management of diabetes, particularly exercise and weight management. Additionally, therapies used to treat rheumatic diseases can be problematic for people with diabetes.

----
[COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES ON BONE HEALTH]
People with diabetes are at high risk of developing bone-related complications, including increased fracture risk, decreased bone mineral density in type 1 diabetes, and increased bone mineral density in type 2 diabetes. Disease complications, such as peripheral neuropathy, can also increase the risk of falls and regional osteopenia, further increasing fracture risk.

----
[FIBROPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS IN DIABETES]
Fibroproliferative disorders, such as limited joint mobility, Dupuytren contracture, and trigger finger, occur more commonly in people with diabetes and can lead to upper limb disability. Limited joint mobility is characterized by joint contractures, decreased passive mobility, and tight, waxy skin on the hands, and can be detected clinically using the prayer sign or table-top sign.

----
[DIABETES MEDICATIONS AND BONE HEALTH]
Certain medications used to treat diabetes, such as thiazolidinediones, can decrease bone formation and bone mineral density, increasing the risk of fractures in people with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, fracture healing may be impaired in people with diabetes, highlighting the need for careful management of bone health in this population.

----
[DIABETES AND GOUT]
People with diabetes are at high risk of developing gout, particularly in the presence of renal impairment and diuretic use. This highlights the need for careful management of uric acid levels and renal function in people with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES-RELATED JOINT MOBILITY ISSUES]
Limited joint mobility is a complication of diabetes that is strongly associated with microvascular complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy in type 1 diabetes, and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes. It is also linked to other fibroproliferative disorders affecting the upper limb, including frozen shoulder, Dupuytren contracture, and carpal tunnel syndrome. The mainstay of therapy for limited joint mobility is excellent glycemic control, which has been shown to reduce the prevalence of this disorder.

----
[CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS FOR LIMITED JOINT MOBILITY]
The development of limited joint mobility in patients with diabetes is associated with several risk factors, including older age, puberty, disease duration, and cigarette smoking. Advanced imaging techniques have demonstrated thickening of skin, tendons, and tendon sheaths in patients with limited joint mobility, while histologic examination of the skin shows altered mucopolysaccharide distribution, elastin, and collagen. Non-enzymatic glycosylation and accumulation of collagen have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this complication.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR LIMITED JOINT MOBILITY]
Physiotherapy, particularly hand therapy, may be beneficial in improving joint contractures and function in patients with limited joint mobility. Corticosteroid injection of flexor tendon sheaths has been reported to lead to resolution of finger contractures in almost two-thirds of cases related to limited joint mobility. Excellent glycemic control remains the mainstay of therapy for this complication.

----
[FROZEN SHOULDER DISORDER]
Frozen shoulder is a disorder characterized by shoulder pain, stiffness, and severely restricted range of motion in all planes. The disorder has three phases: the painful freezing stage with associated nocturnal pain, followed by the adhesive phase with improvement in pain but restricted motion, and finally the thawing phase with gradual improvement in range of motion. Frozen shoulder is one of the fibroproliferative disorders associated with limited joint mobility in patients with diabetes.

----
[OTHER FIBROPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS]
Other fibroproliferative disorders associated with limited joint mobility in patients with diabetes include Dupuytren contracture, carpal tunnel syndrome, and stenosing tenosynovitis (trigger finger). These disorders can cause upper limb disability, especially when combined with limited joint mobility. Excellent glycemic control and physiotherapy may help manage these complications.
----
[DUPTYREN CONTRACTURE TREATMENT]
Surgical treatment is the mainstay of therapy for Dupuytren contracture, although non-surgical options such as local injection of collagenase are also promising. Splinting and intralesional corticosteroids may be considered, but are frequently ineffective. Various surgical approaches are available, including fasciotomy and fasciectomy.
----
[DUPTYREN CONTRACTURE RISK FACTORS]
Diabetes is an important risk factor for Dupuytren contracture, which is present in up to 26% of patients with diabetes. Age and disease duration are the major risk factors for development of Dupuytren contracture in patients with diabetes. Other risk factors include advanced age, male sex, cigarette smoking, manual labor, and alcohol consumption.
----
[STENOSING TENOSYNOVITIS]
Stenosing tenosynovitis, also known as trigger finger, is a condition in which the flexor tendon is prohibited from gliding through the tendon sheath due to thickening of the synovial sheath. This disorder most frequently affects the ring finger, but can also affect other fingers and the thumb. Corticosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is an effective therapy for the majority of patients.
----
[TRIGGER FINGER IN DIABETES]
Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of trigger finger, with a lifetime risk of 10% compared to 2.6% of the general population. Patient age, diabetes duration, and presence of microvascular complications are associated with increased risk of trigger finger in diabetes. Outcomes are typically worse when trigger finger is associated with diabetes, with lower responses to corticosteroid injection and greater need for surgery.
----
[FROZEN SHOULDER]
The text does not provide sufficient information about frozen shoulder in the context of diabetes care, but it mentions that the condition is usually self-limiting, with a mean time to resolution of 30 months. However, some patients may have persistent shoulder pain and restricted range of motion many years after assessment.
----
[CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME IN DIABETES]
Carpal tunnel syndrome is more common in patients with diabetes, particularly those with limited joint mobility, due to accelerated thickening and fibrosis of the flexor tendon sheaths within the carpal tunnel. Glycosylation of collagen may also reduce compliance of connective tissue within the carpal tunnel, increasing the risk of endoneural ischemia. Treatment options for patients with diabetes and carpal tunnel syndrome are similar to those for patients without diabetes, and responses to surgery are usually good.
----
[CHARCOT JOINT DISEASE]
Charcot joint is a destructive arthropathy that affects patients with diabetes, particularly those with severe peripheral neuropathy, leading to severe foot deformity and disability, ulceration, and limb amputation. The disease progresses through several stages, including acute inflammation, gradual worsening of deformity, and eventual remodeling of bone. Charcot joint affects 0.1-0.4% of patients with diabetes and may lead to severe complications if left untreated.
----
[STAGES OF CHARCOT JOINT DISEASE]
The stages of Charcot joint disease include the developmental stage, with acute inflammation and swelling, followed by gradual worsening of deformity, and eventually, the coalescence and reconstructive stages, where bone debris is resorbed and bone sclerosis may occur. The acute phase typically lasts 2-6 months, and the reparative phase lasts up to 24 months, during which time bony deformity may lead to abnormal load bearing, ulceration, and secondary osteomyelitis.
----
[FOOT INVOLVEMENT PATTERNS IN DIABETES]
Five separate patterns of foot involvement have been identified in patients with diabetes, including patterns affecting the forefoot, tarsometatarsal joint, and other areas, leading to distinct radiographic appearances, such as the "sucked candy" appearance. These patterns can help guide diagnosis and treatment of Charcot joint disease in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING FOR CHARCOT JOINT DISEASE]
Diagnostic imaging, including plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scintiscan, can help diagnose Charcot joint disease, particularly in the early stages. MRI scans can show florid bone marrow edema, subchondral cysts, and microfractures, while bone scintiscan can show increased uptake on the bony phase, indicating active disease.
----
[CHARCOT JOINT MANAGEMENT]
Management of Charcot joint depends on the stage of disease, with treatment during the acute phase consisting of immobilization to reduce inflammation, prevent abnormal load-bearing, and stabilize the foot. The standard immobilization method is a non-weightbearing total contact cast, which requires close monitoring and regular adjustment. This treatment should be maintained until swelling and temperature normalize, and radiographs show no further bony destruction.

----
[CHARCOT JOINT TREATMENT OPTIONS]
Recent studies have shown that agents targeting bone turnover, such as bisphosphonates, can be effective in treating Charcot joint. Two randomized controlled trials of bisphosphonates have reported significant improvements in symptoms and bone turnover markers. Additionally, other agents such as TNF-inhibitors and RANKL inhibitors may also be potential treatment options, although further studies are needed to confirm their efficacy.

----
[CHARCOT JOINT SURGERY]
Surgery is generally not considered first-line therapy for Charcot joint, but may be recommended for patients in the reparative phase of disease, particularly those with deformities associated with chronic foot ulcers and joint instability. Various surgical approaches may be used, including arthrodesis, exostotomy, osteotomy, intramedullary rodding, and amputation. However, careful postoperative management is essential to prevent complications such as infection, non-union, and triggering of an acute Charcot reaction.

----
[CHARCOT FOOT OUTCOMES]
Outcomes in patients with Charcot foot are frequently poor, with a high risk of amputation, bracing, and recurrent ulceration. A recent analysis reported a 2.7% annual rate of amputation, a 23% risk of requiring bracing for more than 18 months, and a 49% risk of recurrent ulceration in patients with non-operative management. The presence of open ulcers and other factors can further increase the risk of poor outcomes.
----
[DIABETES AND GOUT COMORBIDITY]
Gout is a common comorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes, with a reported prevalence of 22% in patients with T2DM treated in secondary care. The presence of gout can hinder attempts at exercise and weight loss, and requires additional dietary restrictions to manage both conditions. Patients with gout and diabetes need to avoid alcohol and purine-rich foods, and diuretic therapy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

----
[MANAGING GOUT IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
Treatment options for acute gout flares include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and/or colchicine. Long-term urate-lowering therapy is indicated for patients with recurrent flares, gouty arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic damage, with a target serum urate concentration of < 0.36 mmol/L. Allopurinol is the mainstay of urate-lowering therapy, but may require dose escalation or combination with other agents to achieve target levels.

----
[GOUT PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS]
Gout is an inflammatory arthritis caused by intra-articular deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, and is associated with hyperuricemia, male sex, chronic renal impairment, hypertension, obesity, and certain dietary factors. The relationship between gout and metabolic syndrome is well-recognized, with serum urate concentrations and gout strongly associated with abdominal adiposity and predictive of T2DM development.

----
[DIABETES AND GOUT TREATMENT INTERACTIONS]
Certain antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies, such as losartan and fenofibrate, have weak urate-lowering effects and may be beneficial in patients with diabetes and gout. However, initiation of urate-lowering therapy can exacerbate gout flares, and should be introduced gradually with co-prescription of low-dose colchicine to minimize this risk.
----
[DIFFUSE IDIOPATHIC SKELETAL HYPEROSTOSIS]
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a disorder characterized by increased bone formation, particularly at the entheses. The diagnosis is made radiographically, according to the Resnick criteria, which include the presence of flowing calcification and ossification along the anterolateral aspects of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies. Symptomatic patients are typically treated with analgesics and physiotherapy, with surgery rarely required.
----
[DIABETES AND DISH]
Both obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been identified as risk factors for DISH. The presence of additional metabolic disorders, such as dyslipidemia or hyperuricemia, further increases the risk of DISH associated with diabetes. Patients with DISH have higher rates of hyperglycemia and higher circulating insulin levels, particularly after a glucose load.
----
[OSTEOARTHRITIS AND DIABETES]
Increased load-bearing of articular cartilage is an important risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis, and a strong positive relationship has been reported between obesity and the risk of developing osteoarthritis. While some studies have reported an association between T2DM and osteoarthritis, most have not adequately controlled for body mass index (BMI), and current data indicate that increased BMI, rather than T2DM, is a risk factor for development of osteoarthritis.
----
[RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND DIABETES]
Rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) share several genetic associations, and there is evidence of familial clustering of these disorders. However, there is little evidence that the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is increased in patients with T1DM. Despite these observations, the relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes is complex and requires further study.
----
[DIABETES AND FRACTURE RISK]
Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of fractures, including hip, forearm, and foot fractures, with relative risk estimates ranging from 1.2 to 1.7. The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study found increased risks of any fracture and fractures at specific sites, including the hip, spine, foot, and upper arm, in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. The risk estimates for fracture risk in type 2 diabetes are lower than those in type 1 diabetes. 
----
[MECHANISMS OF SKELETAL FRAGILITY IN DIABETES]
The mechanisms underlying skeletal fragility in type 1 and type 2 diabetes are likely different. In type 1 diabetes, decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is a major contributor to skeletal fragility, with studies showing lower BMD at diagnosis, particularly in children and young adults. Deficiency of insulin and other pancreatic hormones, as well as low levels of IGF-I, may contribute to decreased BMD in type 1 diabetes.
----
[CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO SKELETAL FRAGILITY]
In addition to decreased BMD, other factors contribute to skeletal fragility in diabetes, including an increased propensity to falls due to disease complications such as neuropathy, visual impairment, cerebrovascular disease, and hypoglycemia. These factors may increase the risk of fractures in people with diabetes, particularly those with type 1 diabetes.
----
[OSTEOPOROSIS AND FRACTURES IN DIABETES]
Fragility fractures are a major cause of morbidity and public health expenditure, with the most devastating fracture being that of the proximal femur, which is associated with a high risk of mortality. Osteoporosis is a significant contributor to fracture risk in the general population, and people with diabetes are at increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures due to the underlying mechanisms of skeletal fragility.
----
[DIABETES AND BONE FRACTURE RISK]
People with diabetes, particularly those with type 1 diabetes, have a higher risk of bone fractures, including hip fractures. Studies have shown that individuals with type 1 diabetes have a substantially higher risk of hip fractures compared to those without diabetes. The risk of fractures is also increased in people with diabetes complications, such as neuropathy, which can affect bone density in the distal limbs.
----
[NEUROPATHY AND BONE DENSITY]
Neuropathy, a common complication of diabetes, can negatively impact bone density, particularly in the distal limbs. Research has found that patients with type 1 diabetes and neuropathy have lower cortical bone mass in the distal limbs compared to those without neuropathy. This increased risk of osteopenia contributes to the higher risk of distal limb and foot fractures in people with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS AND FRACTURE RISK]
The presence of diabetes complications, such as neuropathy, can increase the risk of fractures in people with diabetes. Studies have shown that individuals with type 1 diabetes and complications have a higher risk of fractures compared to those without complications. The increased risk of fractures is due to a combination of factors, including decreased bone density and increased risk of osteopenia.
----
[DIABETES AND BONE FRAGILITY]
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk of bone fractures, which may be due to abnormal bone strength and quality not captured by DEXA assessment. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) may contribute to bone fragility by altering biomechanical properties and inhibiting osteoblast differentiation. The presence of AGEs in the skeletons of diabetic animals is higher than in non-diabetic animals, suggesting a potential link to bone fragility.

----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES AND FRACTURE RISK]
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been shown to increase fracture risk in patients with T2DM, particularly in women. Data from randomized controlled trials and observational studies suggest a twofold increase in risk of distal limb fractures in women, and potentially increased risk in men as well.

----
[MECHANISMS OF SKELETAL FRAGILITY IN T2DM]
The mechanisms by which skeletal fragility is increased in T2DM are uncertain, despite higher body weight and bone mass in patients with T2DM. Bone mineral density (BMD) remains an important risk factor for fracture in T2DM, and complications such as neuropathy and nephropathy may contribute to lower BMD and increased fracture risk.

----
[COMPLICATIONS AND FALL RISK IN T2DM]
Complications of T2DM, such as neuropathy, vascular disease, and impaired vision, may increase the risk of falling and fracture. Studies have shown that patients with T2DM have a higher risk of non-spine fractures and falls, particularly those treated with insulin or with a history of disease complications.
----
[DIABETES AND FRACTURE RISK]
Minimizing falls risk is crucial in diabetes care, and this can be achieved by managing macrovascular and microvascular disease complications, preventing hypoglycemia, and optimizing visual acuity. Additionally, medications that increase the risk of falls should be used judiciously. Agents like bisphosphonates, which prevent fractures in non-diabetic osteoporotic populations, may also be effective in those with diabetes. 
----
[FRACTURE HEALING IN DIABETES]
Fracture healing is abnormal in individuals with diabetes, with evidence suggesting that the mechanical and structural properties of healing bone are inferior in diabetic rats compared to control animals. However, therapy with insulin to achieve normoglycemia can promote fracture healing, and administration of insulin at the site of skeletal injury may also mediate bone repair directly. Human studies have reported increased rates of fracture non-union in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES AND BONE HEALTH]
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have complex and adverse effects on skeletal health, involving both direct and indirect pathways. They inhibit bone formation by diverting mesenchymal stem cell precursors from osteoblast to adipocyte lineage and increase bone resorption. In contrast, metformin and sulfonylureas are neutral regarding skeletal health.
----
[INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS IN DIABETES]
Diabetes should be considered a risk factor for fragility fracture, and clinical fracture risk assessment should include recognized risk factors such as age, gender, and body weight. Recently developed fracture risk algorithms can help determine an individual's short- to medium-term absolute fracture risk. Measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) is still helpful in defining fracture risk, even though BMD is often increased in type 2 diabetes. Prescription of TZDs should be avoided in patients with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk of fracture.
----
[DIABETIC CHEIROARTHROPATHY]
Diabetic cheiroarthropathy is a condition characterized by limited joint mobility, often affecting the hands and shoulders of individuals with diabetes mellitus. This condition can lead to functional disability and is associated with other complications of diabetes. Research has shown that long-term glycemic control can influence the onset of limited joint mobility in type 1 diabetes.

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES]
Clinical features of diabetic cheiroarthropathy include limited joint mobility, Dupuytren's contracture, and carpal tunnel syndrome. These conditions can be diagnosed using various methods, including ultrasonography and MRI. Histological and histochemical skin changes have also been observed in individuals with limited joint mobility.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
The pathophysiology of diabetic cheiroarthropathy is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the accumulation of advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) in the skin and joints. This can lead to increased stiffness and limited mobility. Other factors, such as loss of hyaluronan in the basement membrane zone of the skin, may also contribute to the development of this condition.

----
[ASSOCIATION WITH DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetic cheiroarthropathy has been associated with other complications of diabetes, including microalbuminuria and growth impairment. Longitudinal studies have shown that limited joint mobility can be a predictor of these complications, highlighting the importance of early detection and management.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC METHODS]
Various diagnostic methods can be used to detect diabetic cheiroarthropathy, including ultrasonography, MRI, and histological examination of skin biopsies. These methods can help identify individuals with limited joint mobility and guide treatment decisions.
----
[DIABETES AND DUPUYTREN'S DISEASE]
Dupuytren's disease is a condition that has been linked to diabetes mellitus, with studies suggesting that people with diabetes are more likely to develop Dupuytren's disease. Research has also shown that Dupuytren's disease is associated with chronic diabetic complications. The exact relationship between diabetes and Dupuytren's disease is not fully understood, but it is thought that the increased risk may be due to the abnormal growth factor and cytokine expression seen in people with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES AND TRIGGER FINGER]
Trigger finger is another condition that has been linked to diabetes, with studies showing that people with diabetes are more likely to develop trigger finger. The treatment of trigger finger in people with diabetes can be challenging, and research has shown that corticosteroid injections may be less effective in people with diabetes. However, other treatments such as percutaneous surgery may be effective in managing trigger finger in people with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES AND CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME]
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that can occur in people with diabetes, and research has shown that people with diabetes are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. The exact relationship between diabetes and carpal tunnel syndrome is not fully understood, but it is thought that the increased risk may be due to the nerve damage and inflammation seen in people with diabetes.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS IN DIABETES]
The management of musculoskeletal conditions such as Dupuytren's disease, trigger finger, and carpal tunnel syndrome in people with diabetes requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the underlying diabetes and any related complications. Treatment options may include medications, physical therapy, and surgery, and the goal is to manage symptoms, improve function, and prevent further complications.
----
[CHARCOT FOOT IN DIABETES]
Charcot foot in diabetes is a serious complication that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The neurotrophic theory of Charcot foot has been largely discredited, and current research suggests that proinflammatory cytokines play a key role in the development of neuropathic osteoarthropathy. Studies have shown that "silent" bone stress injuries can occur in the feet of diabetic patients with polyneuropathy, highlighting the need for regular foot exams and imaging studies.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING FOR CHARCOT FOOT]
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plain radiography are commonly used to evaluate the diabetic Charcot foot. MRI is particularly useful for detecting early stage Charcot arthropathy and correlating imaging findings with clinical symptoms. Studies have shown that MRI can help identify osteoclastic bone resorption and other changes associated with Charcot foot, allowing for earlier diagnosis and treatment.

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR CHARCOT FOOT]
Treatment options for Charcot foot include immobilization in a weight-bearing total contact cast, bisphosphonates, and other medications. Studies have shown that bisphosphonates can be effective in reducing osteoclastic activity and promoting bone healing. In some cases, surgical intervention such as arthrodesis may be necessary to stabilize the foot and prevent further complications. Early treatment is critical to preventing long-term disability and promoting optimal outcomes.

----
[SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN CHARCOT FOOT]
Research suggests that there may be a systemic inflammatory response in patients with acute Charcot foot, characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This response can contribute to the development of osteoclastic bone resorption and other changes associated with Charcot foot. Further study is needed to fully understand the role of inflammation in Charcot foot and to develop effective treatments for this complication.

----
[CURRENT STANDARDS FOR CHARCOT NEURO-OSTEOARTHROPATHY]
Current standards for Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment, as well as ongoing monitoring and management to prevent complications. This includes regular foot exams, imaging studies, and prompt intervention for any changes or abnormalities. By following these standards, healthcare providers can help promote optimal outcomes and reduce the risk of long-term disability for patients with Charcot foot.
----
[DIABETES AND RHEUMATIC DISORDERS]
People with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing rheumatic disorders, such as osteoarthritis, due to factors like obesity and metabolic changes. Studies have shown that diabetes can increase the prevalence of clinical osteoarthritis, and that metabolic factors can add to the effect of overweight on hand osteoarthritis. Additionally, research has found links between diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a potential common autoimmune susceptibility locus.

----
[OSTEOARTHRITIS AND DIABETES]
Osteoarthritis is a common comorbidity in people with diabetes, and obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis, particularly in the knee. The Framingham Study found that risk factors for incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis in the elderly include obesity, and other studies have confirmed the association between osteoarthritis and metabolic factors.

----
[DIABETES AND GOUT]
Gout is another rheumatic disorder that has been linked to diabetes, with hyperuricaemia being a common complication of diabetes. Research has shown that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing gout, and that the pathogenesis of gout is complex and multifactorial.

----
[COMMON AUTOIMMUNE SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS]
Studies have found evidence of a common autoimmune susceptibility locus between diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that there may be a shared genetic component to these diseases. Research has identified several genetic loci that are associated with both diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, including the IDDM8 region.

----
[DIFFUSE IDIOPATHIC SKELETAL HYPEROSTOSIS (DISH) AND DIABETES]
DISH is a condition characterized by the calcification of ligaments and tendons, and has been linked to diabetes. Research has shown that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing DISH, and that the condition can increase the risk of Charcot arthropathy of the feet.
----
[DIABETES AND OSTEOPOROSIS]
Patients with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of fracture, with studies suggesting a higher risk of non-vertebral fractures, particularly in older women. The Dubbo fracture risk calculator can be used to assess an individual's risk of fracture. Research has also identified discrepancies in bone mineral density and fracture risk in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

----
[FRACTURE RISK IN DIABETES]
The risk of fracture in patients with diabetes is influenced by various factors, including the type of diabetes, insulin and oral antidiabetic medication, and bone mineral density. Studies have shown that patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of fracture compared to those without diabetes. The risk of fracture is also increased in older women with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES AND BONE MINERAL DENSITY]
Research has shown that patients with diabetes, particularly those with type 1 diabetes, may have decreased bone mineral density and bone formation markers. Intensive insulin therapy has been shown to have a positive effect on bone mineral density in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, the relationship between diabetes and bone mineral density is complex and requires further study.

----
[CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS]
The increased risk of fracture in patients with diabetes highlights the importance of assessing and managing bone health in these individuals. Clinicians should consider using fracture risk calculators, such as the Dubbo fracture risk calculator, to assess an individual's risk of fracture and develop strategies to prevent and manage osteoporosis and fractures in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND BONE FRACTURE RISK]
Individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk of bone fractures, particularly hip fractures, due to various factors such as nonenzymatic glycosylation of type I collagen and advanced glycation end products. Studies have shown that older individuals with diabetes have a higher risk of hip fractures compared to those without diabetes. Additionally, patients with insulin-treated diabetes are at a higher risk of low-impact falls, which can lead to fractures.

----
[GLYCATION AND BONE HEALTH]
Nonenzymatic glycosylation of bone collagen can modify osteoclastic activity and differentiation, leading to an increased risk of bone resorption and osteoporosis. Advanced glycation end products can also enhance osteoclast-induced bone resorption, further contributing to bone fragility. The role of glycation in diabetic osteopenia is a significant area of research, with studies suggesting that it plays a crucial part in the development of bone disease in diabetes.

----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES AND BONE HEALTH]
Thiazolidinediones, a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, have been linked to an increased risk of bone fractures. Studies have shown that thiazolidinediones can induce skeletal fragility, particularly in older adults, by regulating osteoclast function and bone mass. The use of thiazolidinediones has been associated with an increased risk of fractures, particularly in patients with a history of osteoporosis or those taking other medications that affect bone health.

----
[DIABETES AND OSTEOPOROSIS]
Diabetes can affect bone health by altering the biomechanical properties of cortical bone, making it more susceptible to fractures. Osteoporosis is a significant concern in patients with diabetes, particularly those with type 2 diabetes, as it can increase the risk of fractures and osteoporotic complications. Research has shown that diabetes can affect osteoclastogenesis, leading to an imbalance in bone remodeling and an increased risk of osteoporosis.

----
[DIABETES TREATMENT AND BONE HEALTH]
Certain diabetes treatments, such as thiazolidinediones, can have a negative impact on bone health, while others, such as metformin, may have a neutral or even positive effect. The choice of diabetes treatment should take into account the potential effects on bone health, particularly in patients with a history of osteoporosis or fractures. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of diabetes treatments on bone health and to develop strategies for preventing and managing osteoporosis in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND FRACTURE HEALING]
Diabetes mellitus can influence the healing of closed fractures, with studies suggesting that the diabetic metabolic state can impact the fracture healing process. Research on spontaneously diabetic rats has shown that the diabetic metabolic state can affect fracture healing. Additionally, studies on the BB Wistar rat with diabetes mellitus have demonstrated that blood glucose control can impact fracture healing. 

----
[INSULIN THERAPY AND FRACTURE HEALING]
Local insulin delivery has been shown to have effects on diabetic fracture healing, with one study demonstrating its impact on the healing process. The use of insulin therapy may be beneficial in promoting fracture healing in patients with diabetes. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of insulin in fracture healing. 

----
[DIABETES-RELATED COMPLICATIONS]
Patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for complications related to fracture healing, including delayed or impaired healing. Open ankle fractures in patients with diabetes mellitus have been studied, with research highlighting the importance of proper management and care. Diabetes-related complications can have a significant impact on patient outcomes and quality of life.
----
[PSYCHOLOGIC EFFECTS OF DIABETES]
Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can affect the psychologic and neuropsychologic status of children and adults, with effects often associated with specific events during the course of diabetes or its management. Children show remarkable psychologic resilience to the diagnosis of diabetes, but may experience adjustment disorders, including depressive symptomatology, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Adults with diabetes also show elevated rates of depression, particularly those with multiple medical co-morbidities. 

----
[DIABETES-RELATED PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS]
During the first 5-10 years of diabetes, most children and adolescents show adequate psychologic functioning, but after 10 years, their rates of anxiety, depression, or eating disorders are markedly increased. Adults with diabetes also show elevated rates of depression, which are twice as high as those reported in the general population. People who have been hospitalized, are older with multiple medical problems, or have a history of past psychopathology are at greatest risk. 

----
[COMPLICATIONS AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY]
Macrovascular disease, chronic foot ulceration, and proliferative retinopathy increase the risk of psychopathology, while lifetime psychiatric disorders such as depression may also increase the risk of later development of complications like retinopathy. Recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in females, is also predicted by poor psychologic functioning and high rates of family dysfunction. 

----
[PHOBIC DISORDERS AND DIABETES]
Phobic disorders are more common in adults with diabetes than in the general population, with fear of blood and injury leading to less blood glucose self-monitoring and poorer control. Fear of hypoglycemia is common and may also lead to premature treatment, resulting in persisting hyperglycemia. 

----
[QUALITY OF LIFE WITH DIABETES]
Quality of life for those with diabetes does not differ from patients with other chronic conditions, such as arthritis. Poor health-related quality of life is associated with biomedical complications, being female, physical inactivity, low income, and recurrently hypoglycemia. Intensive diabetes management is not associated with a deterioration in quality of life. 

----
[INTERVENTIONS FOR PSYCHOLOGIC DISTRESS]
Interventions to reduce psychologic distress include individual psychotherapy or counseling, and group therapy, although their efficacy in affecting mood or metabolic control has not been extensively studied. Cognitive-behavior therapy, which teaches patients problem-solving strategies for stressful situations, is a promising technique for depressive symptoms. Pharmacotherapy, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, has been found to reduce symptom severity.
----
[COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Chronic hyperglycemia and the presence of biomedical complications, such as retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, are predictors of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with diabetes. Structural damage to the brain, including reduction in cortical gray matter density and disruption of white matter structures, is common in both children and adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Cerebral atrophy and altered regional cerebral blood flow are also often present.
----
[PSYCHOLOGIC VARIABLES AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Diabetes management and health outcomes are influenced by reciprocal relationships between metabolic control and psychologic variables, such as locus of control, coping style, and temperament. Additionally, transitory psychologic states like stress, anxiety, and depression can impact diabetes control. Family functioning, particularly in children and adolescents, also plays a significant role in diabetes management, with low family conflict and good communication contributing to better diabetes control.
----
[ADHERENCE TO DIABETES SELF-CARE BEHAVIORS]
Adherence to self-care behaviors, such as taking medicine, complying with diet, glucose monitoring, and exercise regimens, is only weakly related to diabetic control. However, psychologic interventions like psychotherapy, family therapy, and patient empowerment programs can improve goal-setting, problem-solving, and self-motivation in individuals who are non-compliant with their diabetes care.
----
[ROLE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN DIABETES CARE]
A psychologist or other mental health care professional should be part of the diabetes care team to address the psychologic aspects of diabetes management. This is because diabetes and psychology are closely linked, and individuals with diabetes often experience significant psychologic distress, including emotional disturbances and behavioral problems.
----
[PSYCHOLOGIC IMPACT OF DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes can have a significant psychologic impact on individuals and their families, particularly children, who may experience elevated rates of emotional disturbances and behavioral problems. However, research has shown that children and adults with diabetes can exhibit remarkable psychologic resilience in response to their diagnosis.
----
[DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
Depressive symptomatology is more prevalent in women with diabetes (16.1%) compared to men (8.2%), with values comparable to UK normative data. Greater depressive symptomatology is associated with more medical co-morbidities, such as those taking both lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications. This suggests that individuals with diabetes and multiple health conditions may be more susceptible to depressive symptoms.

----
[PSYCHOLOGIC REACTIONS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH DIABETES]
Children and adolescents with diabetes may experience increased depressive symptomatology and internalizing behaviors, such as somatic complaints and social withdrawal, after 2-3 years of diabetes. However, the magnitude of these changes is not typically indicative of clinically significant psychopathology. Externalizing behaviors, such as aggression, are also more common in boys with diabetes, particularly those with consistently elevated blood glucose levels.

----
[LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGIC DISTRESS IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
After 6 years of follow-up, studies have found trivially small increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents with diabetes. The level of psychologic distress shortly after diabetes onset is a strong predictor of symptomatology 6 years later, whereas the degree of metabolic control is not a viable predictor. Even after 10 years of diabetes, older adolescents and young adults with childhood onset of diabetes may report little psychologic distress, but tend to have lower levels of self-esteem and express concerns about their sociability and physical appearance.

----
[PARENTAL CONCERNS AND COPING MECHANISMS]
Parents of children with diabetes, particularly mothers, experience elevated rates of worry and concern, with 46% of mothers reporting worry all or almost all of the time. Mothers' primary coping process is mourning, characterized by feelings of sadness, worry, and tiredness, as well as bouts of crying and irritability. As the duration of illness increases, levels of psychologic distress in parents also tend to increase.
----
[DIABETES AND MENTAL HEALTH]
Individuals with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, compared to the general population. Studies have shown that the prevalence of depressive disturbances in people with diabetes can be as high as 41%, with anxiety symptomatology affecting up to 49% of individuals. The strongest predictors of persisting distress include being female, having less than a high school education, and having multiple diabetes-associated biomedical complications.

----
[PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IN DIABETES]
The risk of depression is doubled in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes, regardless of the type of diabetes. A meta-analysis of 10 studies found that rates of self-reported depression were significantly elevated in patients with diabetes (17.6% vs 9.8%). Additionally, individuals with diabetes are more likely to experience recurrent episodes of depression, with females being at a higher risk than males.

----
[ANXIETY DISORDERS IN DIABETES]
Anxiety disorders are also common among individuals with diabetes, with studies reporting prevalence rates ranging from 11% to 25%. A study found that 20% of individuals with diabetes experienced some form of anxiety disorder, with mood, anxiety, and eating disorders being present in 17% of the sample. Furthermore, adolescents with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing anxiety disorders, with lifetime prevalence rates of suicidal ideation noted to be 26%.

----
[PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN DIABETES]
Psychiatric disorders, including major depression and anxiety disorders, are common among individuals with diabetes. A study found that 40% of individuals with diabetes experienced at least one episode of a psychiatric disorder during the first 10 years of living with diabetes, with 26% experiencing major depression and 20% experiencing some form of anxiety disorder. Maternal psychopathology has also been identified as a potent predictor of subsequent psychiatric disorder in children and adults with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND DEPRESSION]
There is a robust relationship between depression and the subsequent incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with a 60% increase in risk. Depression can increase the likelihood of developing diabetes due to associated behavioral and physiologic risk factors, such as poorer compliance with dietary and weight loss recommendations and increased inflammation. The exact pathologic mechanisms have not yet been established. 

----
[PSYCHOLOGIC REACTIONS TO DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetic complications can disrupt an individual's lifestyle, interfere with self-care activities, and serve as a reminder of failed disease management, leading to psychologic distress. Adults with diabetes and complications often have greater levels of psychologic distress, although this is not always the case. Three types of diabetic complications are known to increase the risk of psychopathology: macrovascular disorders, chronic foot ulceration, and sight-threatening proliferative retinopathy.

----
[DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY]
Macrovascular disorders, chronic foot ulceration, and sight-threatening proliferative retinopathy are associated with increased rates of depression and poorer quality of life in adults with diabetes. For example, patients with chronic unilateral foot ulceration have higher rates of depression and report greater dissatisfaction with their lives. Similarly, patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy have increased psychiatric symptomatology compared to those without retinopathy.

----
[PREVALENCE RATES OF DEPRESSION IN DIABETES]
Prevalence rates of depression in diabetes vary across individual studies, depending on the method used to ascertain depression. Studies using self-report symptom scales yield higher prevalence rates than those using formal structured interviews with clinically established diagnostic criteria. Discrepancies among studies are also caused by differences in subject characteristics, such as age and medical history.
----
[DIABETES AND PSYCHOLOGIC DISTRESS]
Interactions between acute metabolic complications and psychologic distress in diabetes patients can have significant effects on their health outcomes. For example, recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children can be predicted by indicators of poor psychologic functioning in the first year following diagnosis, particularly in girls. Family dysfunction and behavior problems can also contribute to a higher risk of DKA. Additionally, adolescents who experience negativity from their parents towards their diabetes regimen are more likely to experience DKA.

----
[PHOBIC DISORDERS IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
Phobic disorders are twice as common in adults with diabetes as in the general population, with injection or blood and injury phobia, and fear of hypoglycemia being common sequelae of insulin treatment. Studies have found that patients with poorer glycemic control tend to have more symptoms of fear of blood or injury, which can lead to less frequent blood glucose monitoring and increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. The prevalence of injection phobia in diabetes patients is estimated to range from 1.3% to 25%, depending on the criteria used to define the disorder.

----
[FEAR OF HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Fear of hypoglycemia is a common concern among children and adults with diabetes, as well as their spouses and parents. This fear can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life and adherence to their treatment plan. Studies have found that fear of hypoglycemia can lead to increased anxiety and distress, and can even affect a patient's ability to manage their diabetes effectively.

----
[VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND PSYCHOLOGIC DISTRESS]
Visual impairment, such as diabetic retinopathy, can have a significant impact on a patient's psychologic distress and coping efforts. Studies have found that greater impairment of visual acuity is associated with increased psychologic distress and poorer coping efforts, and that fluctuations in visual impairment can also increase distress. However, the degree of psychologic distress secondary to visual loss is not unique to patients with diabetes.
----
[PSYCHOLOGIC FACTORS AND DIABETES]
For individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), poorer health-related quality of life is associated with being older, having biomedical complications, being female, being less physically active, and having a lower income. Chronic hyperglycemia and recurrent hypoglycemia also predict poorer health-related quality of life. These factors can have a significant impact on mental health, social function, and physical health. 

----
[DIABETES-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE]
The use of diabetes-specific quality of life measures, such as the Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) measure, examines factors like satisfaction, impact of diabetes, and diabetes-related worry. Adolescents with diabetes report a relatively good quality of life, but there is a great deal of inter-individual variation in response, which may be due to differences in metabolic control or other biomedical or psychosocial factors. 

----
[METABOLIC CONTROL AND QUALITY OF LIFE]
The relationship between metabolic control and health-related quality of life remains controversial, with some studies finding statistically reliable correlations and others not. Improved metabolic control has sometimes been found to be associated with better diabetes quality of life in adolescents, but not invariably. 

----
[INTENSIVE THERAPY AND QUALITY OF LIFE]
Despite the demands made on individuals treated with intensive therapy, there is no evidence that treatment over a long period of time adversely affects quality of life. In fact, intensive therapy has been associated with improvements in diabetes quality of life over a short-term period. The level of psychologic and medical support provided to patients may also play a role in their quality of life. 

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIC FEAR AND AVOIDANCE]
The development of hypoglycemic fear and the effort to avoid situations that may lead to a hypoglycemic event are not surprising, given the uncomfortable and unpredictable nature of acute hypoglycemic episodes. These episodes are accompanied by aversive symptoms such as trembling, sweating, and light-headedness, which can lead to worries and fears about future episodes.
----
[GROUP THERAPY FOR DIABETES]
Group therapy programs for diabetes have shown small positive effects or no reduction in distress, with a focus on providing medical information and a platform for discussing personal concerns. These groups are typically led by mental health professionals and may run for several weeks or up to a year. Participants often become more comfortable discussing their concerns and may experience benefits such as interpersonal learning and catharsis. However, the efficacy of formal group therapy in improving mood or metabolic control has not been extensively studied.

----

----
[DIABETES AND INFECTIONS]
Diabetes is associated with an increased overall risk of infections, and the presence of diabetes can modify the course of many infections, increasing morbidity and mortality. Multiple disturbances in innate immunity contribute to the increased prevalence of infections in people with diabetes. Impaired phagocytosis, neutrophil chemotaxis, and bactericidal activity are among the most important disturbances of the immune system. 
----
[IMMUNE SYSTEM DISTURBANCES]
Impaired phagocytosis by neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, as well as impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and bactericidal activity, are key disturbances in the immune system of people with diabetes. However, humoral immunity appears relatively unaffected, with plasma levels of antibodies and responsiveness to vaccination remaining relatively normal. Better regulation of diabetes can lead to an improvement in cellular immunity and function.
----
[INFECTION RISK FACTORS]
People with diabetes are at increased risk of skin and mucosal carriage of certain microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida species, which can increase the risk of infection. Additionally, some microorganisms become more virulent in a high glucose environment, and certain infections like urinary tract infections and skin infections are more common in people with diabetes.
----
[SPECIFIC INFECTIONS]
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of certain infections, including urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and necrotizing fasciitis. Uncommon but life-threatening infections, such as rhinocerebral mucormycosis and emphysematous pyelonephritis, also occur almost exclusively in people with diabetes. Furthermore, diabetes increases the risk of tuberculosis and treatment failure.
----
[UNDERLYING FACTORS]
Underlying factors that can predispose people with diabetes to infection include renal failure, obesity, need for hospitalization, indwelling catheters, and delayed wound healing. Vascular disease, such as microangiopathy, can also impair the expression of the immune response and affect the overall function of the microcirculation, leading to severe infections.
----
[DIABETES AND INFECTIONS]
People with diabetes are at increased risk of infections, with a threefold increase in relative risk of adverse outcomes such as intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. Defects in innate immunity, including decreased functions of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, contribute to this increased susceptibility. Infections can also precipitate metabolic derangements, producing a bidirectional relationship between hyperglycemic states and infection.

----
[HOST IMMUNE RESPONSE IN DIABETES]
The host immune response is impaired in people with diabetes, with deficiencies in the innate immune response being more important than changes in adaptive immunity. The presence of diabetes affects innate immune responses, including reduced chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and impaired bactericidal activity. These disturbances contribute to the increased prevalence and severity of infections in people with diabetes.

----
[INFECTIONS IN PRIMARY CARE]
Primary care physicians need to be aware of the relationships between diabetes and infection, particularly infections involving the foot, soft tissues, skin, and nails, as well as urinary tract infections. These infections are commonly encountered in people with diabetes and may be present at diagnosis or be the presenting feature that leads to the diagnosis of diabetes being suspected.

----
[DIABETES AND RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS]
People with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and skin and mucous membrane infections. A recent study confirmed this increased risk, highlighting the importance of considering diabetes as a complicating factor in the clinical course of these infections.
----
[DIABETES AND INFECTIONS]
Diabetes increases the susceptibility to infections, particularly in the lower respiratory tract, due to impaired neutrophil recruitment and phagocytosis. Hyperglycemia impairs opsonophagocytosis, diverting nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) from superoxide production into the aldose reductase-dependent polyol pathway. This impairment can be reversed by normalizing blood glucose levels and pH.

----
[IMMUNE SYSTEM IMPAIRMENT]
Hyperglycemia impairs the innate immune system, affecting macrophage, monocyte, and neutrophil function, including adherence to endothelium, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacteriocidal activity. Additionally, hyperglycemia induces apoptosis, which can impair wound healing and bone growth. Normalizing blood glucose levels can substantially reverse these impairments.

----
[HOST-RELATED FACTORS]
Other host-related factors, such as vascular insufficiency, sensory peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and skin and mucosal colonization with pathogens, can further increase the predisposition to infection in people with diabetes. Abnormalities in the microcirculation can also have indirect adverse effects on immune responses.

----
[OBESITY AND INFECTION RISK]
Obesity, commonly associated with diabetes, increases the risk of certain infections, including nosocomial infections, wound and surgical site infections, respiratory infections, and gastrointestinal tract infections. The presence of obesity also correlates with infected diabetic foot ulcers in people with diabetes.

----
[ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY]
Humoral adaptive immunity appears relatively unaffected in people with diabetes, as evidenced by normal antibody responses to most vaccinations and normal serum antibody concentrations. For example, people with diabetes respond to pneumococcal vaccine equally as well as controls without diabetes.
----
[INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
People with diabetes are more susceptible to certain infections due to factors such as impaired phagocytosis and altered glucose environments. Specific organisms, including Candida albicans and Klebsiella spp., can thrive in the high glucose and acidic conditions often present in diabetes. This can lead to an increased risk of infections, particularly in individuals with diabetic ketoacidosis. 

----
[DIABETIC FOOT COMPLICATIONS]
Vascular disease is a common component of diabetic complications, particularly in the development of diabetic foot infections, ulcers, and gangrene. Vascular insufficiency can lead to local tissue ischemia, enhancing the growth of microaerophilic and anaerobic organisms while depressing the oxygen-dependent bactericidal functions of leukocytes. 

----
[MELIOIDOSIS AND DIABETES]
Melioidosis, caused by the organism Burkholderia pseudomallei, is more common in people with diabetes, with approximately 50% of cases occurring in this population. The organism is resistant to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils, and individuals with diabetes may have impaired neutrophil responses, making them more susceptible to infection. 

----
[KLEBSIELLA INFECTIONS]
Klebsiella infections are a significant concern in diabetes, with diabetes being the most commonly associated underlying condition in patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae bacteremia. The percentage of patients with underlying diabetes can be as high as 49%, and associations have been observed with serotype K1, liver abscess, and other metastatic complications.
----
[DIABETES AND INFECTIONS]
Infections, especially severe ones, can exacerbate hyperglycemia in people with diabetes by worsening insulin resistance and producing stress hormones and cytokines. Infections can also lead to hypoglycemia if symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, and vomiting result in reduced food intake. Additionally, certain infections like malaria and its treatment with quinine can produce hypoglycemia.
----
[HEPATITIS C AND DIABETES]
There is a consistently demonstrated increased prevalence of diabetes among patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, ranging from 24% to 62%, compared to those with other forms of liver disease and control groups. The prevalence of diabetes is higher in HCV-infected individuals who are older than 40 years, non-white, have a high body mass index, and have a family history of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND HCV INFECTION]
The presence of diabetes is associated with worse hepatic fibrosis in HCV-infected individuals, and tumor necrosis factor α has been suggested as a possible candidate for the increased risk of diabetes in these patients. HCV infection is also strongly associated with diabetes among intravenous drug users, independent of HIV infection or use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
----
[HIV/AIDS AND DIABETES]
While HIV/AIDS itself has not been reported to increase the risk of diabetes, the treatment of HIV/AIDS with HAART predisposes individuals to type 2 diabetes, other metabolic risks, and premature cardiovascular disease. This has become a major problem in the management of HIV/AIDS.
----
[BIDIRECTIONALITY OF DIABETES AND INFECTIONS]
There is a bidirectional relationship between diabetes and infections, with infections affecting the etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes, as well as exacerbating diabetes complications. Infections can also have adverse effects on hyperglycemia in established diabetes, and are an important predisposing cause of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia syndrome.
----
[DIABETES AND HIV-ASSOCIATED LIPODYSTROPHY]
Lipodystrophy is a crucial aspect of the association of HAART with insulin resistance, leading to relative preponderance of visceral fat, hepatic steatosis, and fat deposition at other "ectopic" sites. HIV-infected persons with lipodystrophy have a reduction in plasma adiponectin and adipose tissue adiponectin mRNA levels, correlating with insulin resistance and increased cytokine levels. This condition can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

----
[MANAGING GLUCOSE DISORDERS IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS]
A fasting plasma glucose concentration should be checked before initiation of HAART therapy and monitored every 3-6 months, especially in patients receiving changes in treatment or who have significant risk factors for insulin resistance. Dietary guidelines established for the general population remain relevant for the management of glucose disorders in the context of HIV infection. Weight loss through increased activity and caloric restriction should be recommended for overweight HIV-infected patients.

----
[PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR DIABETES IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS]
Metformin improves insulin sensitivity in patients with HIV lipodystrophy and is an effective antidiabetic medication, but should be used with caution in patients receiving an NRTI or with impaired renal function. Thiazolidinediones also improve insulin sensitivity in patients with HIV lipoatrophy, although rosiglitazone treatment may worsen hyperlipidemia. Insulin therapy should be used according to standard recommendations.

----
[DIABETES AND HEPATITIS B]
The presence of hepatitis B markers may influence the natural history of diabetes and its complications, and the relationship may be bidirectional. Chinese HBV-infected patients with type 2 diabetes have been shown to be more likely to develop end-stage renal disease than non-HBV-infected patients with type 2 diabetes. HBV-infected patients also reported earlier onset of diabetes and had a higher frequency of diabetic retinopathy than non-HBV-infected patients.

----
[COMORBIDITIES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS]
HIV-infected adults receiving HAART have an increased incidence of elevated blood pressure and cardiovascular morbidity. Combination HAART for HIV-1 infection is frequently complicated by lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The underlying cellular mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood.
----
[DIABETES AND MUCORMYCOSIS]
Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by fungi of the Rhizopus and Mucor species, which can thrive in high glucose, acidic conditions, making patients with diabetic ketoacidosis more susceptible. The rhinocerebral manifestation of mucormycosis has the highest frequency and is potentially the most lethal in people with diabetes. Diabetes remains the most common underlying factor in most reports of mucormycosis, with a prevalence of 36% and mortality of 44% in people with diabetes.

----
[SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF MUCORMYCOSIS]
Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection that can present with facial or ocular pain, nasal stuffiness, generalized malaise, and fever. Untreated, it is universally fatal, but early recognition can improve survival rates to 20%. Treatment consists of surgical debridement of the involved sinuses and prolonged intravenous therapy with amphotericin B or alternative antifungal agents.

----
[DIABETES AND ENDOPTHALMITIS]
People with diabetes are more prone to secondary endophthalmitis, a rare but devastating metastatic complication of septicemia, with E. coli and Klebsiella being the most likely pathogens. Urinary tract infection is the most common underlying source of infection, and people with diabetes are also more prone to postoperative infections following eye surgery or infections secondary to eye trauma.

----
[DIABETES AND PERIODONTAL DISEASE]
People with diabetes are very prone to periodontal disease, with a two- to fourfold increased risk compared to the non-diabetic population. This increased risk is significant, and periodontal disease can have serious consequences for people with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES AND MALIGNANT OTITIS EXTERNA]
Malignant otitis externa is an invasive infection of the external auditory canal and skull base that typically arises in elderly people with diabetes, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the nearly always causal organism. Most cases (86-90%) have been reported in patients with diabetes, making it a significant concern for people with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS]
People with diabetes are at an increased risk of mortality and morbidity from community-acquired pneumonia, including infections such as influenza, S. pneumoniae, and Legionella. The risk of bacteremia following pneumococcal infection is also increased, and viral shedding may be more prolonged in individuals with diabetes. This may influence decisions regarding initiation and duration of antiviral therapy.
----
[DIABETES AND PERIODONTAL DISEASE]
Diabetes can increase the risk of periodontal disease, particularly if left untreated, leading to loss of attachment of ligament fibers and supporting alveolar bone, and potentially resulting in tooth loss. Aggressive and difficult-to-treat forms of periodontitis are more common in adults with diabetes. However, the prevalence of periodontal diseases among people with well-controlled diabetes is not increased.
----
[DIABETES AND INVASIVE ASPERGILLOSIS]
In rare cases, people with diabetes can develop invasive aspergillosis, a severe and extensive fungal infection that can affect the skull base and lead to serious complications, including blindness and hearing impairment. A case study of a 59-year-old male with a 20-year history of diabetes and nephropathy highlights the importance of prompt treatment and lifelong therapy with antifungal medications such as voriconazole.
----
[DIABETES AND TUBERCULOSIS RISK]
Diabetes has been confirmed to be associated with an increased risk of active tuberculosis, with an overall increase in risk of approximately threefold. The risk is greatest among younger people, in areas of high tuberculosis incidence, and in non-North American populations. This association is thought to reflect impaired innate immunity and a reduced adaptive T-helper type 1 response.

----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIC IMPACT ON TUBERCULOSIS]
The public health impact of the diabetes epidemic on tuberculosis incidence may be particularly high in countries such as India and China, which are at the forefront of the diabetes epidemic. In India, diabetes accounts for 14.8% of pulmonary tuberculosis and 20.2% of smear-positive tuberculosis, with an excess risk in urban areas.

----
[DIABETES EFFECT ON TUBERCULOSIS OUTCOMES]
Diabetes not only increases the risk of tuberculosis but also leads to worse tuberculosis outcomes and has adverse effects on responses to treatment. People with diabetes are more likely to remain smear-positive at the end of treatment and may require a more prolonged period of treatment.

----
[DIABETES AND OTHER INFECTIONS]
People with diabetes are also at increased risk for other infections, such as melioidosis and S. aureus pneumonia, which may result from higher rates of nasal carriage of S. aureus in people with diabetes. Any respiratory infection in patients with diabetes is associated with increased mortality.

----
[DIABETES AND INFECTION MORTALITY]
In the USA, people with diabetes are reportedly at a higher risk of mortality from respiratory infections, with a fourfold increased risk compared to those without diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS]
Diabetes is a risk factor for urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly in postmenopausal women, with a two- to threefold increase in risk. Asymptomatic vaginal E. coli colonization is also more prevalent in postmenopausal women with diabetes receiving insulin treatment. This increased risk may be due to impaired cytokine secretion or a reduced polymorphonuclear inflammatory response.

----
[COMPLICATIONS OF UTIS IN DIABETES]
Diabetes increases the risk of complications from UTIs, including serious or unusual forms of infection and the need for prolonged hospitalization. It is also a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis in women, with an odds ratio of 4.1. Additionally, people with diabetes under 44 years old have a three- to fivefold increased risk of UTIs.

----
[DIABETIC AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY AND UTIS]
Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is a predisposing factor to UTIs, affecting the sympathetic and parasympathetic afferent fibers to the bladder and causing decreased reflex detrusor activity. This can lead to impaired bladder sensation, bladder distension, and increased residual urine volume, resulting in recurrent upper UTIs.

----
[ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA IN DIABETES]
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is more common in people with diabetes, with a prevalence rate of 26% in women with diabetes compared to 6% in women without diabetes. However, a randomized controlled trial found no benefit in screening or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in people with diabetes, and this remains a controversial issue.

----
[SYMPTOMATIC UTI RISK IN DIABETES]
Studies have confirmed an increased risk of symptomatic UTIs in people with diabetes, with one study finding a 20% overall risk in women with type 2 diabetes. Another study found that the risk extends to recurrence rates and also affects males.
----
[DIABETES AND UTI RISK FACTORS]
Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of developing urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to factors such as glycosuria, poor glycemic control, and decreased urinary cytokine excretion. Other risk factors include a history of previous UTI, obstruction, and longer duration of diabetes. Renal papillary necrosis and chronic renal failure may also contribute to the risk of UTIs in patients with diabetes.

----
[COMMON UTI PATHOGENS IN DIABETES]
The most commonly reported organism causing UTIs in patients with diabetes is E. coli, followed by Klebsiella, particularly in severe forms of UTI such as emphysematous pyelonephritis. Other organisms that can cause UTIs in patients with diabetes include Acinetobacter species, group B streptococci, and P. aeruginosa, especially in those with a history of recent instrumentation or hospitalization.

----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF UTI IN DIABETES]
Uncomplicated UTIs in patients with diabetes may be asymptomatic, but when symptoms are present, they are generally similar to those experienced by the non-diabetic population, including dysuria, frequency, and urgency. Infection of the lower urinary tract usually presents with these symptoms, while upper tract infection with renal involvement may present with fever, flank pain, chills, and rigors.

----
[COMPLICATIONS OF UTI IN DIABETES]
Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of developing complications from UTIs, including renal papillary necrosis and perinephric abscess. A poor response to antibiotic therapy should raise suspicion of these complications, which can present with symptoms such as flank and abdominal pain, fever, and renal functional impairment.

----
[EMPHYSEMATOUS CYSTITIS AND PYELONEPHRITIS]
Emphysematous cystitis and emphysematous pyelonephritis are uncommon but severe complications of UTIs in patients with diabetes. Emphysematous cystitis is characterized by the presence of gas in the bladder wall and presents with hematuria, pneumaturia, and abdominal pain. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is almost exclusively limited to patients with diabetes and carries a grave prognosis, requiring aggressive treatment in hospital and intravenous antibiotic therapy.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients with diabetes requires a high index of suspicion, particularly in those with diabetic neuropathy, renal dysfunction, or renal papillary necrosis. Microscopic examination of urine, urine culture, and sensitivity tests are essential for diagnosis. In febrile patients or suspected upper tract infections, blood culture is also necessary to detect bacteremia or septicemia. 
----
[IMAGING TECHNIQUES FOR URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS]
Imaging techniques such as plain abdominal radiography, ultrasonography, and CT scans are useful in diagnosing and managing UTIs in patients with diabetes. These techniques can help rule out obstructive uropathy, stones, and emphysematous infection, and confirm the diagnosis of renal abscess, mass, or perinephric spread of infection.
----
[TREATMENT OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Treatment of UTIs in patients with diabetes should be tailored to account for local antibiotic resistance patterns, previous history of UTI, and other risk factors. Uncomplicated UTIs can be treated with oral antibiotics such as co-trimoxazole, fluoroquinolones, or nitrofurantoin, while complicated infections require hospitalization and parenteral antibiotics. 
----
[COMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Complicated UTIs in patients with diabetes may require more prolonged courses of antibiotics (7-14 days) due to the higher risk of upper urinary tract involvement and relapse. Repeated urine culture to document bacteriologic cure 2-4 weeks post-treatment is advisable to reduce the risk of subsequent relapse. 
----
[PATHOGENS AND PATHOGENESIS OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
The most common pathogens responsible for UTIs in patients with diabetes are E. coli and Klebsiella. Vasculopathy of the renal circulation is believed to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of UTIs in diabetes, emphasizing the importance of vascular disease in the clinical manifestation of severe infections.
----
[DIABETES AND LIVER ABSCESSES]
Diabetes is a significant risk factor for liver abscesses, particularly those caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). In fact, diabetes is the most common underlying risk factor for the virulent K1 serotype of K. pneumoniae, which is often associated with liver abscesses. Studies have shown that 33% of pyogenic liver abscess cases are associated with diabetes, and that diabetes increases the risk of developing a liver abscess by 9-fold.

----
[INFECTION RISK AND DIABETES]
People with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing infections, including liver abscesses, due to impaired neutrophil phagocytosis and other factors. Poor glycemic control can also contribute to the development of invasive liver abscesses by impairing the body's ability to fight off infections. Additionally, diabetes is associated with a higher 30-day post-discharge mortality rate compared to patients without diabetes.

----
[TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT]
Treatment for liver abscesses typically involves therapeutic percutaneous drainage procedures, as well as antibiotic therapy with cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones. It is also important to obtain specimens for culture and susceptibility testing to guide treatment. In some cases, antifungal agents such as fluconazole may be considered for patients with invasive disease.

----
[OTHER INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS]
In addition to liver abscesses, people with diabetes are also at risk for other intra-abdominal infections, including emphysematous cholecystitis, which is a rare but severe variant of acute cholecystitis. This condition is more common in patients with diabetes and is often caused by gas-forming organisms such as enteric Gram-negative rods and anaerobes.
----
[INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
People with diabetes, particularly those who inject insulin, are at risk of asymptomatic nasal, mucosal, and skin colonization with potential pathogens such as S. aureus, which can lead to increased risk of staphylococcal pneumonia and other infections. Nasal colonization with S. aureus is also associated with a higher risk of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection. Additionally, mucosal and skin colonization with C. albicans is common and can lead to cutaneous or incisional infections. 
----
[SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS]
Skin and subcutaneous tissues are frequent targets of infection in diabetes, particularly in association with poor glycemic control. Common infections include candidal infections, bacterial infections such as furunculosis, and fungal infections like mucormycosis. Sensory neuropathy, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and hyperglycemia predispose patients with diabetes to skin and soft tissue infections, with additional risk factors including a past history of cellulitis and peripheral vascular disease.
----
[RISK FACTORS FOR CELLULITIS]
Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing cellulitis, with risk factors including a past history of cellulitis, edema, peripheral vascular disease, tinea infection, and dryness of the skin. The predominant organisms involved in cellulitis are group A streptococcus (GAS) and S. aureus, although other organisms like S. pneumoniae can also cause cellulitis in certain settings.
----
[DIABETES AND LIVER ABSCESSES]
People with diabetes are at risk of developing liver abscesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Liver abscesses can be diagnosed using imaging studies like CT scans and can be treated with drainage and antibiotics. Patients with underlying diabetes and fever should be evaluated for liver abscesses, particularly if they have right upper quadrant pain or other symptoms suggestive of liver infection.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF NECROTIZING FASCIITIS]
Necrotizing fasciitis is initially misdiagnosed as a benign soft tissue infection, requiring a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Early disease may be characterized by severe local pain, disproportionate to or preceding other clinical features such as local inflammation and cellulitis, fever, and systemic toxicity. Skin changes may be minimal in the early phase of infection. Plain radiographs, ultrasound, CT, and MRI scans can assist in diagnosis and management.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF NECROTIZING FASCIITIS]
Surgical debridement and fasciotomy are the mainstays of therapy for necrotizing fasciitis. Timely diagnosis, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and aggressive surgical debridement of affected tissue are crucial components of management. The antibiotic cover can be tailored according to culture and sensitivity results, and additional supportive therapy in an intensive care environment should be provided where possible and as necessary.

----
[FOURNIER GANGRENE]
Fournier gangrene is a specific form of necrotizing fasciitis involving the perineum, scrotum, and penis, with a very high overall mortality rate. Diabetes is the most common predisposing condition, present in 32-60% of cases. Infection is usually polymicrobial, and diagnosis is predominantly clinical, with radiologic imaging techniques revealing subcutaneous gas and delineating the extent of involvement.

----
[COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES]
People with diabetes are at greater risk of deeper soft tissue infections, including pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, and Fournier gangrene. These infections can lead to severe complications, such as gangrene and ulceration, and require prompt and aggressive treatment to prevent mortality. Diabetes is also associated with a higher risk of staphylococcal septicemia and substantially higher mortality rates compared to non-diabetic patients.
----
[DIABETES AND OSTEOMYELITIS]
Diabetes increases the risk of hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis, with a two- to sixfold increased risk, and predisposes individuals to infections involving unusual organisms. Early diagnosis and targeted antimicrobial therapy are crucial for successful treatment, and a multidisciplinary approach is required. Surgical intervention may be necessary if medical treatment fails or in the presence of complications.

----
[INSULIN INJECTION SITE INFECTIONS]
Infections at the site of insulin injections are rare, even when traditional hygienic practices are not applied. However, abscesses at needle sites can occur in individuals receiving subcutaneous insulin infusions. Administration of insulin through clothing is not associated with an increased risk of infection.

----
[DIABETES AND SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS]
There is an association between diabetes and an increased risk of surgical site infections, particularly after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Hyperglycemia may contribute to this increased risk, and improved glucose control during the operative and perioperative period can reduce the risk of postoperative infections.

----
[DIABETES AND FOOT INFECTIONS]
Foot infection is the most common soft tissue infection associated with diabetes, and disease-related peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease are important in its etiology. Detailed coverage of this topic is provided in another chapter, but it is a critical issue for individuals with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES AND INFECTIONS]
The presence of diabetic complications can affect the treatment of infections, and patients with diabetes may require longer courses of antibiotic therapy or more aggressive treatment approaches. Additionally, patients with diabetes may be at increased risk of complications from certain medications, such as those that impair hearing or balance. Careful monitoring of treatment responses is also crucial, especially in cases like tuberculosis. 
----
[IMPORTANCE OF VACCINATIONS]
People with diabetes generally have a normal response to vaccines and should receive immunizations according to established guidelines. Routine immunization against pneumococcus and influenza is recommended, particularly for elderly patients with diabetes or those with additional co-morbidities. Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce hospital admissions significantly during influenza outbreaks.
----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL DURING INFECTIONS]
Physicians should be aware of the importance of careful monitoring of diabetic control in the presence of infection, as even mild degrees of hyperglycemia can be associated with increased mortality in severe illness. Patients with type 1 diabetes or those receiving insulin need to be aware of the probability of changing insulin requirements in response to infection, and hospital admission may be necessary if severe destabilization of glycemic control occurs.
----
[DIABETES AND TRANSPLANTATION]
Both allograft rejection and risk for infection appear to be higher in transplant recipients with diabetes. Poor perioperative glycemic control can increase the risk of acute allograft rejection and infection in renal transplant recipients. Diabetic heart transplant recipients may also have a higher risk of serious infection in the early postoperative period.
----
[DIABETES AND DIALYSIS]
Ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is a common form of treatment for end-stage renal disease in people with diabetes. Patients receiving dialysis require careful management of their diabetes to prevent complications and ensure optimal treatment outcomes.
----
[IMMUNE SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Immune system dysfunction is a common complication in diabetes, with studies showing impaired leucocyte functions, altered cytokine and nitric oxide secretion, and defects in innate immunity. This can predispose diabetic patients to infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Hyperglycemia can also impair host defense mechanisms, making it harder for the body to fight off infections.

----
[INFECTION RISK IN DIABETES]
Diabetic patients are at a higher risk of developing infections, particularly those caused by bacteria and fungi. Studies have shown that diabetes can enhance the expression of proapoptotic genes and caspase activity, contributing to impaired healing and increased susceptibility to infections. Additionally, obesity, which is often associated with diabetes, can also increase the risk of infection.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN INFECTION MANAGEMENT]
Good glycemic control is crucial in managing infections in diabetic patients. Intravenous insulin-glucose regimens are recommended in situations where oral food intake is significantly impaired. However, it is also important to avoid hypoglycemia, and interaction between the diabetes care team and other involved specialists should be initiated as early as possible to ensure optimal care.

----
[PERIOPERATIVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Perioperative glycemic control is important in patients with diabetes, particularly in the context of surgery or other medical procedures. While the exact mechanisms and recommendations are not fully detailed in the provided text, it is clear that managing blood glucose levels is critical in preventing complications and promoting optimal recovery.

[DIABETES AND HIV INFECTION]
Diabetes and HIV infection have a complex relationship, with antiretroviral therapy increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and disturbed body fat compartmentalization. The International Diabetes Foundation and Adult Treatment Panel III criteria are used to diagnose metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected patients.

----
[DIABETES AND LIVER DISEASE]
Diabetes mellitus is associated with chronic hepatitis B and C, with a potential link to the extent of liver fibrosis. Research has also shown that chronic hepatitis B viral infection independently predicts renal outcome in type 2 diabetic patients. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C is a significant concern, highlighting the need for close monitoring and management of these patients.

----
[INFECTIONS IN DIABETIC PATIENTS]
Diabetic patients are more susceptible to various infections, including malignant external otitis, pulmonary mucormycosis, and zygomycosis. These infections can have severe consequences, such as endophthalmitis, which can lead to vision loss. Diabetic patients are also more prone to periodontitis and tooth loss, emphasizing the importance of proper oral care and hygiene.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS]
The management of metabolic complications associated with antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection requires careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits. Guidelines from the European AIDS Clinical Society and the International AIDS Society-USA panel provide recommendations for the prevention and management of metabolic diseases in HIV-infected patients. These guidelines emphasize the need for regular monitoring of metabolic parameters, such as glucose and lipid levels, and prompt intervention to prevent or manage metabolic complications.
----
[URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common complication in people with diabetes, with risk factors including symptomatic bacteriuria and fungal infections. Studies have shown that women with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing UTIs, and multidrug-resistant uropathogens are more prevalent in patients with diabetes. Effective management of UTIs in adults with diabetes is crucial to prevent complications.

----
[EMPHYSEMATOUS INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Emphysematous infections, such as emphysematous pyelonephritis and emphysematous cholecystitis, are rare but serious complications that can occur in people with diabetes. These infections are characterized by the presence of gas in the tissues and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Clinicians should be aware of the risk factors and clinical presentation of these infections to provide timely and effective management.

----
[DIABETIC FOOT INFECTIONS AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS]
While the provided text does not specifically discuss diabetic foot infections, it highlights the importance of managing infections in people with diabetes. Other complications, such as pyogenic liver abscess and bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis, can also occur in individuals with diabetes, emphasizing the need for comprehensive care and monitoring.

----
[INFECTION RISK AND PROGNOSIS IN DIABETES]
Studies have shown that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing various infections, including pyogenic liver abscess and bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis. The prognosis for these infections can be poor, especially if not managed promptly and effectively. Clinicians should be aware of the risk factors and take steps to prevent and manage infections in individuals with diabetes.

----
[RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Pulmonary infections can also occur in people with diabetes, highlighting the need for comprehensive respiratory care and monitoring. Clinicians should be aware of the risk factors and clinical presentation of respiratory infections in individuals with diabetes to provide timely and effective management.
----
[DIABETES AND INFECTIONS]
Diabetes increases the risk of infections, particularly in patients undergoing surgery. Perioperative hyperglycemia is a strong correlate of postoperative infection in type II diabetic patients after coronary artery bypass grafting. Studies have shown that perioperative glycemic control is crucial in reducing the risk of infectious complications in patients with diabetes.

----
[PERIOPERATIVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Perioperative glycemic control is essential in patients with diabetes to reduce the risk of infectious complications. Research has shown that early peri-operative glycaemic control can reduce allograft rejection in patients with diabetes mellitus. The American Diabetes Association has published clinical practice recommendations for glycemic control in patients with diabetes.

----
[INFECTIONS IN DIABETES]
Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of various infections, including candidal infections, staphylococcal infections, and necrotizing fasciitis. Studies have identified specific populations, such as those with diabetes, as being at higher risk for these types of infections. Infections can be severe and life-threatening, emphasizing the need for proper management and prevention strategies.

----
[DIABETES AND SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS]
Diabetes and poor glucose control are associated with an increased risk of surgical-site infections. Research has shown that patients with diabetes are at higher risk for surgical-site infections, particularly in cardiothoracic surgery. Effective glycemic control and proper wound care are essential in reducing the risk of surgical-site infections in patients with diabetes.
----
[DIABETES IN CHILDHOOD STATISTICS]
An estimated 700,000 children have diabetes worldwide, with 100,000 new cases diagnosed annually, and the incidence has been increasing by up to 5% annually. Type 1a diabetes mellitus accounts for almost all cases in children younger than 10 years, and for more than 90% among older children of European ancestry. The presence of two or more islet autoantibodies predicts the development of diabetes in those less than 10 years. Despite research efforts, prevention of Type 1a diabetes mellitus is still elusive.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES IN CHILDREN]
Diabetes in children is diagnosed based on symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, fatigue, and random blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). Oral glucose tolerance testing is rarely needed, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is present at diagnosis in fewer than 30% of cases in developed countries. The primary focus of DKA management in children is prevention of cerebral edema.
----
[MANAGEMENT OF CHILDHOOD DIABETES]
Childhood diabetes is managed in the outpatient setting by a team including a pediatrician, diabetes nurse educator, dietitian, and pediatric social worker or psychologist. In-depth initial and continuing education of parents and patients is crucial for lowering the risk of acute and long-term complications. Insulin pump or basal bolus multiple daily injections are the standard of insulin therapy in children.
----
[NUTRITION AND EXERCISE PLANNING]
Nutrition planning should be based on carbohydrate counting or exchange system, with a macronutrient and micronutrient composition similar to that for healthy children without diabetes. Regular exercise is recommended, but requires careful planning of insulin and nutritional management to prevent severe hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is largely preventable but is still the most common serious complication of childhood diabetes.
----
[TARGET HBA1C LEVELS AND PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE]
The target HbA1c level for children with diabetes is below 58 mmol/mol (less than 7.5%), which is achievable by most children and adolescents. Age-specific psychologic care should include screening for and treatment of family dysfunction, developmental maladjustments, and psychiatric disorders in both patients and their caregivers. All children with diabetes should be screened for dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, elevated blood pressure, retinopathy, and other conditions at an appropriate age and duration of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) has been rising by 3-5% per year over the past 40 years, with significant variations in prevalence among different racial and ethnic groups. According to the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study, the proportions of prevalent cases of diabetes in the US population vary by age group and race/ethnicity. The highest prevalence of T1DM is found in non-Hispanic white individuals.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES PATHOGENESIS]
Type 1 diabetes is caused by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, with the initial step being the development of islet autoimmunity marked by the presence of islet autoantibodies. The presence of more than one autoantibody combined with susceptibility HLA-DR,DQ genotypes identifies individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. Once tolerance is broken to more than one islet autoantigen, most individuals progress to diabetes within 10 years.
----
[PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION]
Efforts to prevent T1DM have been focused on identifying and eliminating environmental triggers, but there is a lack of consensus on which factors initiate and promote islet autoimmunity. Intervention at the "dysglycemic" stage, characterized by mild asymptomatic hyperglycemia, may preserve endogenous insulin secretion and prevent complications of T1DM. Preservation or regaining of residual insulin secretion after diagnosis may also be beneficial, but immunomodulatory agents used in tertiary prevention may carry unacceptable long-term risks.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
The management of type 1 diabetes, particularly in children, involves assessing appropriate long-term treatment after initial metabolic stabilization and HLA-DR,DQ typing. The presence of islet autoantibodies and susceptibility HLA-DR,DQ genotypes can help identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, allowing for early intervention and potential prevention of complications.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES IN CHILDREN]
Diagnosis of diabetes in children can be challenging due to absent or equivocal symptoms, but testing for islet autoantibodies can help rule in diabetes in cases with mild presentation. The quality of commercial assays for islet autoantibodies varies widely, and testing for at least three autoantibodies provides 80% predictive value. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) may also be detected in children with islet autoimmunity progressing to overt diabetes.
----
[DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA) PRESENTATION]
The clinical presentation of DKA includes abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which can mimic an acute abdomen, as well as mild to moderate dehydration, Kussmaul respiration, and progressive somnolence. DKA results from absolute or relative deficiency of circulating insulin and a corresponding increase in counter-regulatory hormones. The severity of DKA is categorized by the degree of acidosis, ranging from mild to severe.
----
[DKA SEVERITY CATEGORIES]
The severity of DKA is categorized by the degree of acidosis: mild (venous pH 7.2-7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L), moderate (venous pH 7.1-7.2 or bicarbonate < 10 mmol/L), and severe (venous pH < 7.1 or bicarbonate < 5 mmol/L). These categories are important for guiding treatment and management of DKA.
----
[DKA AT DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
In the USA, patients younger than 20 years with a clinical diagnosis of T1DM and T2DM presented in DKA in 29% and 10% of cases, respectively. DKA is more often found among younger children and in children with lower socioeconomic status who encounter barriers in accessing medical care. Intensive community intervention to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of childhood diabetes may help reduce the prevalence of DKA at diagnosis.
----
[CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF DIABETES]
The cardinal symptoms at the diagnosis of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and fatigue. The classic presentation of DKA affects fewer than 30% of cases presenting in developed countries today, and most children present with milder hyperglycemia of shorter duration. However, 75% of children have symptoms for more than 2 weeks, suggesting that the diagnosis could be made earlier in many cases.
----
[DIABETES KETOACIDOSIS TREATMENT]
Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) involves fluid and insulin replacement, as well as careful monitoring of electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and phosphorus. Potassium replacement should be given in a combination of forms, with no more than half as K2HPO4 to avoid excessive phosphorus administration. Severe acidosis is reversible with fluid and insulin replacement, but bicarbonate therapy is not recommended unless the acidosis is profound.

----
[COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES KETOACIDOSIS]
Cerebral edema is a potential complication of DKA, particularly in children, and can be fatal in over 20% of cases. Risk factors for cerebral edema include profound dehydration, hyperventilation, and acidosis at presentation, as well as bicarbonate therapy and excessive fluid administration. Signs and symptoms of cerebral edema include headache, change in mental status, and focal neurological findings.

----
[MANAGEMENT OF CEREBRAL EDEMA]
Treatment of cerebral edema includes administration of mannitol, decreasing fluid rate, and elevation of the head of the bed. Mannitol therapy may need to be repeated, and intravenous hypertonic saline can be used as an alternative. Early intervention is essential, and radiographic studies should be obtained after treatment of cerebral edema.

----
[PREVENTION OF HYPOLYCEMIA]
Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels can help prevent hypoglycemia in patients with DKA. For acute hypoglycemic episodes, the insulin infusion may be temporarily discontinued for up to 15 minutes if necessary.

----
[RECURRENT DIABETES KETOACIDOSIS]
Recurrent DKA episodes can occur in patients with poor metabolic control, previous episodes of DKA, and limited access to medical care. Nearly 60% of DKA episodes occur in 5% of children with recurrent events, and treatment should focus on addressing underlying factors contributing to these episodes.

----
[MONITORING AND CALCULATIONS IN DIABETES KETOACIDOSIS]
Hydration status should be assessed, and fluid deficit and osmolality calculated to guide fluid and electrolyte replacement. Serum electrolytes, glucose, and other laboratory values should be repeated every 2-4 hours or more frequently in severe cases. Calculations, such as anion gap and corrected sodium levels, can help guide treatment decisions.
----
[DIABETES EDUCATION IN CHILDHOOD]
Diabetes education is a continuous process that must be repeated to be effective, and it should be adapted to the age of the child. Infants and toddlers require special consideration due to their unpredictable eating and activity patterns, while school-aged children can be involved more directly in their diabetes management. Education should focus on monitoring blood glucose levels, injections, and recognition of hypoglycemic symptoms. 
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN CHILDHOOD]
Children with diabetes should be seen in the ambulatory setting at least every 3 months, with more frequent visits if treatment goals are not met. During these visits, overall health and well-being are assessed, and growth and vital signs are monitored. A physical examination is also performed to ensure the child's health is on track. 
----
[TRANSITION TO SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN REGIMEN]
Patients can be transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen once diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has resolved and they are able to eat. The insulin infusion should not be discontinued until 15-30 minutes after the first subcutaneous injection of rapid-acting insulin, and long-acting insulin analogs can replace insulin infusion 4-6 hours after injection. Bedside monitoring of blood ketones helps to titrate insulin dose and prevent relapse. 
----
[PEDIATRIC AMBULATORY DIABETES CARE]
Diabetes is primarily managed in the outpatient setting by a team including a pediatrician, diabetes nurse educator, dietitian, and pediatric social worker or psychologist. In communities with low population density, care may be provided by the child's primary care physician, who should work closely with a regional diabetes care team. Healthcare providers must be sensitive to cultural needs and barriers to care that may arise with minority children. 
----
[INITIAL EDUCATION AND CULTURAL SENSITIVITY]
Initial education should provide a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes and its treatment to ensure families feel confident in providing diabetes care at home. Healthcare providers must be cognizant of cultural needs and barriers to care, and interpreters should be utilized when needed to ensure effective communication and care.
----
[INSULIN REPLACEMENT GOALS]
The primary goal of insulin replacement is to provide sufficient basal insulin levels and higher insulin levels after meals. The choice of insulin regimen depends on individual factors such as age, duration of diabetes, dietary and activity patterns, and metabolic targets. Patient and family preferences should also be considered when determining an insulin regimen. This personalized approach helps ensure effective diabetes management.

----
[INSULIN PUMP THERAPY BENEFITS]
Insulin pump therapy is considered the best way to restore the body's physiologic insulin profile. It delivers a variable programmed basal rate that corresponds to the diurnal variation in insulin needs, and the user can initiate bolus doses before meals and to correct hyperglycemia. Insulin pump therapy has been shown to improve HbA1c levels and reduce the severity of hypoglycemia compared to multiple daily injections.

----
[INSULIN PUMP THERAPY REQUIREMENTS]
Insulin pump therapy requires the user to manually enter the amount of carbohydrate being consumed, and the pump calculates the amount of insulin needed based on previously entered variables. Rapid-acting insulin analogs are preferred for use in pumps, and insulin should be administered at least 10-15 minutes before a meal to reach effective levels in time. A longer lead time may be needed if preprandial blood glucose is higher than 150 mg/dL.

----
[INSULIN PUMP THERAPY COMPLIANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING]
Compliance with insulin pump therapy can be challenging, particularly for young children, picky eaters, and disorganized patients. Common issues include infrequent blood glucose testing, incorrect carbohydrate counting, and missing boluses altogether. Patients and their families must be instructed on troubleshooting and treatment of hyperglycemia, particularly if ketones are present, and should always have syringes available in case of a pump failure.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT AND EDUCATION]
Regular follow-up visits are essential for effective diabetes management, and should include routine screening for diabetes-associated complications and co-morbidities. A multidisciplinary team, including a dietitian and social worker or psychologist, can provide ongoing education and support to help patients and their families manage diabetes and develop an individualized plan for care.
----
[PREMIXED INSULINS]
Premixed insulins contain a mixture of regular and NPH insulin in various fixed ratios, which can be useful for children who do not want to draw insulin from separate vials or need to reduce the number of injections. However, the main disadvantage is the lack of flexibility in adjusting separate insulin doses. Premixed insulins are available for use in pen injector devices. This can be particularly helpful for teenagers who may struggle with compliance.
----
[NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT]
Nutritional management is a key component of diabetes care and education in children, and a pediatric dietitian should be part of the diabetes care team if available. The goal is to achieve optimal glycemic control, reduce cardiovascular risk, and promote psychosocial well-being through a healthy dietary regimen. A thorough dietary history should be obtained, including the family's dietary habits and the child's typical meal times and patterns of food intake.
----
[INSULIN PUMP AND MDI THERAPY]
Insulin pump and MDI therapy utilize carbohydrate counting, which allows for flexibility in food choices but requires expert education and commitment. This approach may not be suitable for all families or situations, such as school lunches or teenagers. Alternative meal planning approaches, such as exchange planning and constant carbohydrate meal planning, can also be used to manage carbohydrate intake.
----
[GLYCEMIC INDEX AND LOAD]
The use of the glycemic index can provide additional benefits to glycemic control, with low glycemic index carbohydrate foods such as wholegrain breads and fruits helping to lower post-prandial hyperglycemia. A glycemic load approach, which takes into account the glycemic index and portion size, has not been fully explored in children but may be a useful tool in meal planning.
----
[AGE-SPECIFIC ADVICE]
Breastfeeding should be encouraged in infants, and insulin pump therapy should be considered for patients who require small doses of insulin. Toddlers may require more frequent smaller meals, and their insulin regimen should match this eating pattern. Insulin pumps can be particularly helpful in young children or infants who have multiple meals and snacks and require multiple small doses of rapid-acting insulin.
----
[DIETARY PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH DIABETES]
Dietary planning for children with diabetes involves eating a well-balanced diet with daily energy intake distributed as follows: 50-55% carbohydrates, 30-35% fat, and 10-15% protein. Meals and snacks should be eaten at the same time each day, and snacks can be used to prevent and treat hypoglycemia. It's also important to gauge energy intake to maintain appropriate weight and body mass index.

----
[MACRONUTRIENT INTAKE GUIDELINES]
Specific guidelines for macronutrient intake in children with diabetes include limiting sucrose intake to up to 10% of total energy, monounsaturated fat to up to 20%, polyunsaturated fat to less than 10%, and saturated fat and trans fatty acids to less than 10%. Additionally, n-3 fatty acids should be limited to 0.15 g/day.

----
[FIBER AND SODIUM INTAKE]
Recommended fiber intake for children older than 1 year is 2.8-3.4 g/MJ, and children older than 2 years should eat at least (age in years + 5) g/day of fiber. Sodium intake should be limited to less than 6 g/day to avoid increasing the risk of hypertension.

----
[AVOIDING CERTAIN FOODS AND SUBSTANCES]
Children with diabetes should avoid foods high in sodium, excessive protein intake, and specially labeled diabetic foods that are often high in fat and may contain sweeteners with laxative effects. Artificial sweeteners can be consumed in doses not exceeding acceptable daily intakes.

----
[ALCOHOL INTAKE AND CELIAC DISEASE]
Alcohol intake can induce prolonged hypoglycemia in young people with diabetes, and carbohydrate should be eaten before, during, and/or after alcohol intake. Additionally, approximately 10% of patients with type 1 diabetes have serologic evidence of celiac disease, and those with positive intestinal biopsy or symptoms should be treated with a gluten-free diet.

----
[EXERCISE AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Children with diabetes derive the same health and leisure benefits from exercise as children without diabetes and should be allowed to participate with equal opportunities and equal safety. Exercise can help with diabetes management, and physiologically, there is a decrease in pancreatic insulin secretion during exercise in children without diabetes.
----
[EXERCISE PRECAUTIONS]
Children with diabetes should not participate in strenuous exercise if their pre-exercise blood sugar level is high and urine or blood ketones are present. This is crucial to prevent complications. It is essential to monitor blood sugar levels and ketones before engaging in physical activity. 

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA DEFINITION]
Hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose level below 70 mg/dL (4 mmol/L), and severe hypoglycemia usually occurs at levels of 40-50 mg/dL (2.2-2.7 mmol/L) or lower. Prolonged exposure to these low levels can lead to severe hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening. 

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK FACTORS]
Younger age, longer diabetes duration, barriers to access to care, and the presence of psychiatric disorders or chaotic family environments increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Additionally, lower HbA1c levels can also be a risk factor for hypoglycemia, but appropriate intensive insulin treatment can lower this risk. 

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS]
The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia can be categorized into autonomic, neuroglycopenic, behavioral, and non-specific symptoms. These include trembling, pounding heart, cold sweatiness, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, irritability, and hunger. Early warning signs are more challenging to identify in young children. 

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA TREATMENT]
For mild or moderate symptomatic hypoglycemia, treatment involves providing immediate oral, rapidly absorbed glucose or sucrose, such as glucose tablets or sweet drinks. The goal is to raise the blood glucose level to 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). Retesting blood glucose in 10-15 minutes is essential to ensure adequate response. 

----
[EXERCISE AND INSULIN ADJUSTMENTS]
When exercise is anticipated, children with diabetes may require adjustments to their insulin dosing. The site of insulin injection should also be taken into account, as exercise can increase insulin absorption. For example, insulin should not be administered in the legs before running. Adjustments to rapid-acting insulin and long-acting insulin doses may be necessary to prevent hypoglycemia during exercise.
----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK FACTORS]
Patients with diabetes are at increased risk for hypoglycemia during sleep, after alcohol ingestion, and during or after exercise. Untreated celiac disease and Addison's disease may also increase the risk of hypoglycemia. It is essential for patients and families to be aware of these risk factors to adjust glucose monitoring and insulin regimens accordingly.

----
[NOCTURNAL HYPOGLYCEMIA]
Nocturnal hypoglycemia is often asymptomatic and can be suspected if morning blood glucose is low or if there are episodes of confusion, nightmares, or seizures during the night. It can be confirmed with blood glucose monitoring during the night and may be prevented by including more protein and fat in the bedtime snack.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA EFFECTS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING]
Studies have shown an association between hypoglycemia and decreased cognitive functioning in children with type 1 diabetes, particularly in those diagnosed before the age of 5-6 years. Even mild to moderate hypoglycemia may impair school functioning and overall well-being, and severe hypoglycemia can increase parental and patient worry, poor sleep, and emergency room visits.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA PREVENTION AND TREATMENT]
Hypoglycemia is frequently predictable and should be prevented by recognizing symptoms and treating them immediately and appropriately. Children with diabetes should always carry a source of rapid-acting glucose and wear identification noting that they have diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring can help detect and avoid hypoglycemia.

----
[SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA TREATMENT]
In severe hypoglycemia, where the child has an altered mental status and is unable to assist in their care, urgent treatment with parenteral glucagon or dextrose is required. Glucagon is given intramuscularly or subcutaneously, and the dose varies by age and weight. Dextrose can be given intravenously by trained medical staff if glucagon is unavailable or recovery is inadequate.

----
[SICK DAY MANAGEMENT]
Children with diabetes in good metabolic control should not experience more illness or infections than children without diabetes. During illness, it is essential to retest blood glucose in 20-30 minutes to confirm that target glucose has been maintained.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT DURING ILLNESS]
Insulin therapy must never be stopped during a sick day, although the dose may need to be decreased if the child is vomiting or eating less than usual. A fasting patient still requires approximately 40% of the usual daily insulin dose to cover basic metabolic needs and prevent ketoacidosis. Extra doses of rapid-acting insulin may be needed to correct hyperglycemia and prevent ketoacidosis.

----
[HYPERGLYCEMIA TREATMENT]
With blood glucose concentrations greater than 200 mg/dL, treatment includes usual high blood glucose correction, injection of rapid-acting insulin, and monitoring of blood ketones and urine ketones. The amount of rapid-acting insulin injected depends on the level of blood ketones, ranging from 1 unit for each 50 mg/dL above 100 mg/dL to 10-20% of the total daily dose.

----
[INSULIN PUMP MANAGEMENT]
Patients using insulin pumps who develop hyperglycemia and moderate or large urine ketones must consider the possibility of an interruption in insulin delivery. If blood glucose levels do not decrease after an insulin bolus, a correction bolus of short-acting insulin should be given by injection, and the pump infusion set should be changed.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA TREATMENT]
If hypoglycemia persists and the patient is unable to tolerate oral intake, an injection of low-dose glucagon may reverse the hypoglycemia and enable oral fluid intake to resume. The dose of glucagon is one unit per year of age up to 15 years, and it can be repeated every 2-4 hours.

----
[HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTE MANAGEMENT]
Hydration status must be followed closely, and households should maintain a supply of sugar and electrolyte-containing fluids. Fever, hyperglycemia, and ketonuria can increase fluid losses, and patients should be equipped with the tools necessary to avoid dehydration and ketoacidosis.

----
[VACCINATIONS AND EDUCATION]
Children with diabetes should receive routine childhood immunizations, including the influenza vaccine. Healthcare providers should equip families with the tools necessary to manage sick days, including face-to-face education, written instructions, and telephone advice. Most parents should be able to manage sick days independently over time, but may need repeated support.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT GOALS]
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a key measure of mid to long-term glycemic control, with elevated levels predicting long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications. The American Diabetes Association recommends an HbA1c level of 7.0% or lower for most individuals. However, HbA1c has its limitations and should be used in conjunction with other measures, such as documented hypoglycemia and quality of life. Ideally, HbA1c should be measured four to six times a year in younger children and three to four times a year in older children.

----
[SELF-MONITORING OF BLOOD GLUCOSE]
Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) provides immediate and daily documentation of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, helping to determine insulin requirements and detect hypoglycemia. Blood glucose should be measured at least 4-6 times a day, including during the night, after meals, and in association with exercise or vigorous sports. The frequency of SMBG is associated with improved HbA1c in patients with type 1 diabetes.

----
[RECORDING GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
A logbook or electronic memory device should be used to record patterns of glycemic control and adjustments to treatment. The record book should contain time and date of blood glucose reading, insulin dosage, and notes of special events, such as illness, exercise, or hypoglycemic episodes. This record is useful for tracking progress and making informed decisions about treatment.

----
[HYDRATION AND DEHYDRATION]
Oral water is sufficient to prevent dehydration in uncomplicated cases of hyperglycemia. However, if there is ongoing fluid loss from diarrhea or vomiting, hydration liquids should contain salt in addition to water, such as Pedialyte or Rehydralate. In cases where blood glucose is falling below 200 mg/dL, sports drinks may be administered to provide a quick source of glucose.

----
[TARGETS FOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) recommends individualized targets for HbA1c and SMBG. The safest recommendation for glycemic control in children is to achieve the lowest HbA1c that can be sustained without severe hypoglycemia or frequent moderate hypoglycemia. Targets should be determined on an individual basis, taking into account the child's unique needs and circumstances.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN CHILDHOOD]
The diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) significantly impacts the lives of affected families, posing relentless challenges and increasing the risk of adjustment problems, psychiatric disorders, and other psychologic issues. Children with T1DM and their parents require ongoing psychologic care to address these challenges. The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) provides recommendations for psychologic care. Young people with T1DM are more frequently diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, disordered eating, and neurocognitive problems than the general population.

----
[SCREENING FOR DYSLIPIDEMIA]
Screening for dyslipidemia in children with T1DM should commence after the age of 2 years if there is a family history of hypercholesterolemia or cardiovascular disease (CVD), or otherwise at age 12 years, and should be repeated every 5 years thereafter if normal. Glycemic control should be established in newly diagnosed patients prior to screening. Children with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels 130-159 mg/dL (3.4-4.1 mmol/L) should obtain glucose control, dietary, and exercise counseling.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL TARGETS]
The targets for glycemic control in children with T1DM include optimal, suboptimal, and high-risk levels, as outlined in Table 51.4. These targets are intended as guidelines, and each child should have their targets individually determined. The targets include HbA1c levels, fasting or preprandial blood glucose (BG) levels, post-prandial BG levels, bedtime BG levels, and nocturnal BG levels.

----
[CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING]
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices are available and in development, measuring interstitial fluid glucose every 1-20 minutes. These devices provide real-time results and store data for later download, allowing patients and healthcare professionals to review results and make informed insulin dosage adjustments. CGM may become the standard of care in children with T1DM, enabling more sophisticated approaches to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and improving glucose control.
----
[SCREENING FOR MICROALBUMINURIA]
Screening for microalbuminuria with a random spot urine sample should occur annually in children once they are 10 years of age and have had diabetes for more than 5 years. The diagnosis of microalbuminuria requires documentation of two abnormal samples out of three samples over a period of 3 – 6 months. If values are increasing or borderline, more frequent screening should occur. 
----
[DEFINITION AND TREATMENT OF MICROALBUMINURIA]
Microalbuminuria is defined as albumin excretion rate 20 – 200 mg/min, or 30 – 300 mg/24 hours in 24-hour urine collections, and is the first clinical manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be started once persistent microalbuminuria is confirmed, even if the blood pressure is normal. 
----
[MANAGING HYPERTENSION IN DIABETES]
Hypertension in adults with diabetes is associated with the development of both microvascular and macrovascular disease. Blood pressure should be checked and reviewed at each clinic visit, and hypertension is defined as systolic or diastolic blood pressure above the 95th percentile for the child's age, sex, and height. 
----
[LIPID MANAGEMENT IN DIABETES]
The treatment goals for lipid management in diabetes are LDL < 100 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) > 35 mg/dL, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL.

Each stage has specific milestones, such as incorporating developed skills and healthcare goals into the care plan, and arranging solo consultations. The transition process is tailored to the individual's needs and progress.

----
[TRANSFER TO ADULT CARE]
The final stage of transition involves physical transfer to an adult care provider, with the transition case manager arranging the first appointment and following up to address any issues. The adult staff meet with the patient prior to transfer, and support and follow-up are provided to ensure a smooth transition. This stage typically occurs between the ages of 15-25.

----
[FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION]
After transfer to adult care, the transition case manager provides ongoing support and follow-up, including minimum 6-monthly follow-ups for 2 years. Multiple vehicles for follow-up are used, including formal letters, telephone calls, and SMS reminders. This ensures that any concerns or issues are addressed promptly and that the patient is adapting well to adult care.
----
[TRANSITIONAL CARE FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH DIABETES]
Adolescents with diabetes often experience a critical period of change when transitioning from children's to adult diabetes services. This transition can be challenging, and health workers may view their trial-and-error approach to adaptation as risky behavior. However, this process can also be seen as an opportunity for individuals to learn and understand how to manage their condition. A preventive model of care that promotes self-care and readiness to change can be more effective than a problem-oriented approach.

----
[READINESS TO CHANGE AND SELF-CARE]
Readiness to change is a process that occurs over time and is linked to an individual's compliance with their medical regimen. It involves incorporating the consequences of illness into everyday life and making the illness a part of life. Relationship-building between healthcare professionals and adolescents is crucial in facilitating this transition and promoting self-care. Adolescents want to receive written and verbal information about transition and have opportunities to meet the new team prior to transition.

----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY PREVALENCE]
The number of women with diabetes becoming pregnant is increasing, in line with the rise in type 2 diabetes among women of reproductive age, with rising obesity levels also contributing to the growing number of women developing glucose intolerance during pregnancy. This increase poses significant challenges for diabetes care and management during pregnancy. The prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy is a growing concern, with implications for maternal and fetal health. 

----
[PERINATAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY]
Perinatal mortality and morbidity are increased in diabetic pregnancies, mainly due to higher stillbirths and congenital malformations rates, which are three- to fivefold higher than in non-diabetic pregnancies. Maternal diabetes significantly impacts pregnancy outcomes, making proper management and care crucial. Glycemic control is essential to minimize the risks associated with diabetic pregnancies. 

----
[METABOLIC CHANGES IN PREGNANCY]
Metabolic changes occur in pregnancy to facilitate nutrient transfer to the fetus, with maternal insulin resistance helping to divert glucose to the fetus. However, women with pre-gestational diabetes have insufficient insulin to counter the rise in insulin resistance and require increasing insulin therapy during pregnancy. Women without diabetes before pregnancy may become glucose intolerant if they have insufficient insulin reserves. 

----
[MATERNAL DIABETES EFFECTS ON PREGNANCY]
Maternal diabetes affects all aspects of pregnancy, from conception to the timing and mode of birth, with major early effects on embryogenesis and the risk of malformations. Glycemic control is critical at this time, as glucose is teratogenic to the developing embryo. Maternal diabetes also affects fetal pancreatic islets and β-cell development, which may contribute to the increased risk of diabetes among children of mothers with diabetes. 

----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Good maternal diabetic control lessens the risk to the fetus of malformations, accelerated fetal growth, stillbirth, and neonatal hypoglycemia, as well as the risk of future obesity and diabetes for the child. Achieving maternal glucose levels as near to normal as safely possible is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes. Close maternal and fetal surveillance for medical and obstetric complications is also crucial. 

----
[PREGNANCY RISKS FOR MOTHERS WITH DIABETES]
Pregnancy poses certain risks for the mother with diabetes, including detrimental effects on retinopathy and nephropathy, although these effects are usually limited to those with significant clinical disease beforehand and are self-limiting. Proteinuria and microalbuminuria are risk factors for pre-eclampsia and preterm birth, and pregnancy in women with underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with maternal morbidity and mortality. 

----
[PRE-PREGNANCY CARE AND PREPARATIONS]
The clinical care of women with pre-gestational diabetes and those with previous gestational diabetes mellitus should begin before pregnancy, with preparations including optimizing glycemic control, ensuring folic acid supplementation, and stopping all unsafe medications for pregnancy. Women should be screened for retinopathy and nephropathy before pregnancy and given relevant information concerning risks to themselves and any unborn child. 

----
[ANTENATAL MANAGEMENT]
Antenatal management should focus on achieving maternal glucose levels as near to normal as safely possible and close maternal and fetal surveillance for medical and obstetric complications. National evidence-based clinical guidelines for diabetes in pregnancy should be followed to ensure all women have access to the best available care. This approach can help minimize the risks associated with diabetic pregnancies and optimize outcomes for both mother and child.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION IN PREGNANCY]
The classification of diabetes in pregnancy is crucial for both epidemiologic and clinical purposes, but a uniform classification is still needed. Most women with pre-gestational diabetes in pregnancy have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, while others may have monogenetic, mitochondrial, or secondary forms of diabetes. Correctly identifying the type of diabetes during pregnancy can be challenging, especially when the woman is diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy. This is because some may be in the early phases of Type 1 diabetes, while others may have previously undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes.
----
[MONOGENETIC DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
Monogenetic diabetes, such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), may be diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy, especially in women with asymptomatic forms. Clinical features that suggest MODY include fasting hyperglycemia, a small blood glucose rise during an oral glucose tolerance test, and a requirement for insulin treatment during previous pregnancies. Screening selected women can increase the likelihood of finding a glucokinase gene mutation, which is associated with MODY. This form of diabetes is relatively rare, affecting less than 2% of the antenatal population.
----
[COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETIC PREGNANCY]
Many fetal complications of diabetic pregnancy are a direct result of maternal hyperglycemia, rather than the type of maternal diabetes. However, the medical, obstetric, and social risk factors differ between women with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Understanding these differences is essential for optimizing pregnancy care and improving outcomes for both mother and fetus. Glycemic control is critical in reducing the risk of complications, and improving pregnancy outcomes depends on achieving optimal glycemic control from conception to birth.
----
[EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETIC PREGNANCY]
The number of pregnant women with pre-gestational and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing, mainly due to the rising prevalence of obesity in women of childbearing age. Despite advances in scientific knowledge and improvements in fetal and maternal care, pregnancy outcomes for women with diabetes remain broadly similar to those in 1989. Stillbirths and congenital malformations are three to five times higher in diabetic pregnancies than in non-diabetic pregnancies, highlighting the need for improved glycemic control and pregnancy care.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
Diabetes in pregnancy is partly caused by an increase in renal clearance of glucose early in pregnancy, and maternal insulin sensitivity is reduced in late pregnancy by approximately 50%. To maintain glucose tolerance, maternal β-cells must compensate for this fall in insulin sensitivity by increasing first and second-phase insulin responses approximately threefold by the last trimester. This capability is presumably decreased in women with diabetes.

----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE IN PREGNANCY]
Pregnancy-related maternal insulin resistance benefits fetal growth by aiding glucose transfer to the fetus, a process termed "facilitated anabolism". Maternal to fetal glucose transfer in the fasting state is enhanced by maternal lipolysis, which occurs in late pregnancy, with free fatty acids becoming the main maternal fuel substrate and diversion of glucose to the fetus. This process of enhanced lipolysis has been termed "accelerated starvation" and is attributed to the actions of human placental growth hormone and other placental hormones.

[METABOLIC CHANGES IN PREGNANCY]
The metabolic changes in pregnancy facilitate the transfer of glucose and amino acids to the fetus. An increase in hepatic glucose output in late pregnancy, owing to hepatic insulin resistance, ensures that maternal glucose is available to the fetus between meals. Transgenic mice that overexpress human placental growth hormone develop severe peripheral insulin resistance, similar to that found in the third trimester of pregnancy, confirming its importance in the insulin resistance of late pregnancy.

----
[CYTOKINES AND INSULIN RESISTANCE]
The cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) impairs insulin signaling in vitro and is increased in the second and third trimester of human pregnancy. In late pregnancy, circulating TNF-α levels are inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity. The role of other adipokines, including leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and resistin, in insulin resistance in pregnancy still needs to be defined.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN PREGNANCY]
The CEMACH audit assessed the outcomes of 3808 pregnancies in women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and found significant differences in pre-pregnancy planning, obesity, social deprivation, risks of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia, and retinopathy, all of which may affect clinical care before and after pregnancy. Perinatal mortality, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and congenital anomaly rates were similar for both types of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) who become glucose-tolerant postpartum still have β-cell dysfunction and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin release, increasing their susceptibility to future diabetes. Obesity and weight gain postpartum are major determinants for the development of diabetes. These women are also at risk for impaired suppression of lipolysis, further contributing to their increased risk of developing diabetes.

----
[FFECT OF MATERNAL DIABETES ON PREGNANCY]
Maternal diabetes affects all aspects of pregnancy, from fertility to birth, and the subsequent health of the child and adult. Hyperglycemia is the most obvious metabolic abnormality of a diabetic pregnancy, but other metabolic abnormalities, such as "fuel-mediated teratogenesis," can also influence outcomes. Diabetic complications, like microalbuminuria, can increase the risk of obstetric complications, including hypertension and pre-eclampsia.

----
[PLACENTA AND DIABETES]
A healthy pregnancy depends on a healthy placenta, but maternal diabetes can cause functional and structural changes in the placenta. Insulin receptors are highly expressed in the trophoblast and endothelial cells of the placenta, and maternal and fetal insulin regulate nutrient transfer between the maternal and fetal circulation. Placental insulin-binding capacity is increased in macrosomic diabetic pregnancies compared to non-diabetic placentas.

----
[FERTILITY AND DIABETES]
Before the availability of insulin, most women with diabetes died within 2 years of diagnosis, and pregnancy was rare. Nowadays, although most young women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) can be reassured about their fertility, delayed menarche and early menopause are common, especially if diabetic control is poor. Other potential causes of infertility in women with T1DM include weight-related amenorrhea, primary ovarian failure, and eating disorders.

----
[METABOLIC CHANGES IN PREGNANCY]
Carbohydrate tolerance deteriorates in women with diabetes by the second trimester, in parallel with the physiologic decrease in insulin sensitivity. Women with T1DM therefore need increased insulin to maintain glycemic control from the mid-second trimester. In contrast, in the first trimester, insulin sensitivity increases, and insulin requirements are less than at the start of pregnancy for well-controlled women with T1DM.
----
[DIABETES AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES]
Diabetic pregnancies have a higher risk of congenital anomalies, particularly heart and CNS abnormalities, with a prevalence of 41.8/1000 births, which is twofold higher than non-diabetic pregnancies. The caudal regression syndrome is a pathognomonic anomaly of diabetes, being 200 times more common in diabetic pregnancies. Severe cardiac anomalies, including transposition of the great arteries and tricuspid atresia, are also more common in diabetic pregnancies.

----
[ANIMAL STUDIES ON DIABETES AND EMBRYOGENESIS]
Rodent studies have shown that diabetes-associated fetal malformations are similar to those in humans, and that hyperglycemia modifies the expression of key apoptotic regulatory genes in the pre-implantation blastocyst. Insulin treatment in hyperglycemic female rodents has been shown to protect the blastocyst from changes caused by hyperglycemia, suggesting that insulin may act as a growth factor during early embryogenesis.

----
[MISCARRIAGE RATES IN DIABETIC PREGNANCIES]
Miscarriage rates among women with diabetes are broadly similar to the general population, at 12-15%, although the risk is increased when diabetic control is poor. However, obtaining precise data on miscarriage rates is difficult due to selection bias, recall bias, and the exact definition of the upper time limit.

----
[MECHANISMS OF DIABETES-RELATED TERATOGENESIS]
Animal studies suggest that glucose is the major teratogen in diabetic pregnancies, and that hyperglycemia at the time of embryogenesis exposes the fetal mitochondria to a high influx of glucose-generated pyruvate, leading to an excess of reactive oxygen species and increased oxidative stress. This provides a plausible unifying mechanism by which supraphysiologic concentrations of metabolic substrates could be teratogenic.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital abnormalities, and there is a clear link between maternal glucose control in early pregnancy and the risk of malformations. Studies have shown that tight glycemic control from conception to the end of organogenesis can reduce the incidence of birth defects. However, despite this evidence, the incidence of serious birth defects has not changed significantly over the last few decades.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND MALFORMATIONS]
Research has shown that the odds ratio for congenital malformation increases by 1.2 for each standard deviation unit rise in HbA1c level at the time of conception. When pre-conceptional HbA1c levels are within the normal range, the absolute risk of congenital anomaly is approximately 2%, but this risk increases to 3% and 10% when HbA1c levels are 2 and 8 standard deviations above normal, respectively.

----
[INTENSIVE GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT]
Intensive glycemic management at the time of conception has been shown to improve malformation rates. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) found that women in the intensive treatment group had significantly lower HbA1c levels at conception and a lower incidence of congenital malformations compared to those in the conventional treatment group.

----
[FETAL PANCREATIC DEVELOPMENT]
Understanding the genetic and intrauterine environmental factors that influence fetal pancreatic and β-cell development is crucial for understanding the trans-generational etiology of type 2 diabetes. Immunoreactive insulin is detectable in the human fetal pancreas by 7 weeks after conception, and primitive islets are formed by 12-13 weeks, with evidence of functional fetal β-cells by the end of the first trimester.

----
[OXIDATIVE STRESS AND MALFORMATIONS]
Oxidative stress, which occurs in response to maternal hyperglycemia, can lead to increased lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial swelling, DNA damage, and altered gene expression. Antioxidative agents such as N-acetylcysteine and vitamins E, C, and folic acid have been shown to protect against diabetes-induced malformations in rat embryos.

----
[MYOINOSITOL AND DIABETIC TERATOGENESIS]
Myoinositol plays a crucial role as a precursor for secondary messengers and may contribute to diabetic teratogenesis. Studies have shown that inositol supplementation can protect against glucose-mediated malformation in cultured rodent embryos and diabetic pregnant rodents.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
Fetal insulin secretion in humans occurs in response to glucose and amino acids by 13 weeks' gestation. Maternal hyperglycemia increases placental fetal transfer of glucose, resulting in fetal hyperinsulinemia. This can lead to accelerated growth patterns, including abdominal fat disposition and visceral growth, which can be visible on routine clinical ultrasound as an increased abdominal circumference from 28 weeks' gestation.

----
[FACTORS INFLUENCING FETAL GROWTH]
Maternal glycemic control influences fetal growth as early as the first trimester, with elevated first-trimester HbA1c levels being a strong predictor of macrosomia. Accelerated growth patterns occur through maternal hyperglycemia causing fetal hyperinsulinemia, and there is a strong association between birth weight and fetal insulin in human diabetic pregnancies.

----
[INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTORS]
IGF-I is an important fetal growth factor in humans, and its bioavailability is regulated by IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). In diabetic pregnancies, cord blood IGFBP-1 is lower, suggesting increased IGF-I bioavailability. IGF-II is a placental growth factor that facilitates maternal-fetal nutrient transfer in late pregnancy, and its function may depend on fetal insulin.

----
[STILLBIRTH RISK IN DIABETIC PREGNANCIES]
The risk of stillbirth in diabetic pregnancies is approximately fivefold higher than in non-diabetic pregnancies. Identifiable causes of stillbirth in diabetic pregnancies include congenital malformations, chromosomal abnormalities, infection, and intrauterine growth restriction, although approximately one-quarter of cases are unexplained.

----
[LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF DIABETIC PREGNANCIES]
β-Cell function and insulin sensitivity in children and young adulthood are influenced by intrauterine growth restriction. Maternal diet and placental function during critical spatiotemporal windows in embryonic and fetal life can affect the expression of key developmental pancreatic genes through epigenetic modifications of DNA methylation.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY STATISTICS]
Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of stillbirth, with a rate of 25.8/1000 births for women with Type 1 diabetes and 29.2/1000 births for women with Type 2 diabetes, compared to a general UK antenatal population rate of 5.7/1000 births. A study of 2536 births found a 4.7 times higher risk of stillbirth for women with diabetes. Poor glycemic control throughout pregnancy is a significant factor in stillbirths, with 64% of stillbirths occurring in women with HbA1c levels above 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) in the first trimester.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN PREGNANCY]
Suboptimal glycemic control early and late in pregnancy is more frequent in women who experience stillbirths, with 67% of stillbirths occurring in women with HbA1c levels above 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) in the third trimester. In contrast, a reference group of 236 consecutive births to women with Type 1 diabetes had HbA1c levels above 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) in only 33% of cases in the first trimester and 4% in the third trimester. This highlights the importance of tight glycemic control throughout pregnancy to minimize the risk of stillbirth.

----
[ACCELERATED FETAL GROWTH IN DIABETES]
Accelerated fetal growth is a common feature of pregnancies in women with diabetes, characterized by an increase in abdominal circumference while head circumference remains on the 50th centile. This is illustrated in Figure 53.1, which shows a progressive increase in abdominal circumference over time, indicating accelerated fetal growth. This phenomenon is associated with poor glycemic control and can increase the risk of stillbirth and other pregnancy complications.
----
[NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA DEFINITION]
Neonatal hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose value of less than 2.6 mmol/L. In healthy neonates, low blood glucose concentration is often a normal physiologic response to metabolic adaptation to extrauterine life. However, certain groups such as macrosomic infants and preterm infants are at higher risk of hypoglycemia due to various factors.
----
[NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK FACTORS]
Macrosomic infants are at higher risk of hypoglycemia due to postpartum hyperinsulinemia secondary to in utero β-cell hyperplasia, which inhibits hepatic glucose production. Preterm infants also have a higher risk of hypoglycemia due to more variable swings in blood glucose. Early feeding can reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, and breastfeeding within 30 minutes of birth is recommended for mothers with diabetes.
----
[STILLBIRTH RISK FACTORS IN DIABETIC PREGNANCIES]
Diabetic pregnancies have a higher risk of stillbirth, with identifiable risk factors including diabetic nephropathy, smoking, and lower social status. Obesity and increasing maternal age are also risk factors for stillbirth in the non-diabetic population, and the stillbirth risk is higher in women with type 2 diabetes than type 1 diabetes in certain populations.
----
[CAUSES OF EXCESS STILLBIRTHS IN DIABETIC PREGNANCIES]
The cause of excess stillbirths in diabetic pregnancies is uncertain, but chronic fetal hypoxia and acidosis appear to be major contributory factors. Fetal hyperinsulinemia and excessive fuel substrate may increase oxygen demand in insulin-sensitive tissues, exceeding placental oxygen supply. Amniotic erythropoietin is a marker of chronic fetal hypoxia and is higher in diabetic than non-diabetic pregnancies.
----
[NEONATAL COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETIC PREGNANCIES]
Neonates born to mothers with diabetes have a higher risk of being born preterm, being large for gestational age, having a congenital malformation or birth injury, and developing hypoglycemia requiring treatment. Neonatal admission to a special care baby unit is common, often reflecting hospital policy rather than the need for intensive care.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY RISKS]
Pregnancy may affect pre-existing microvascular and macrovascular disease in women with diabetes, but does not usually have a lasting detrimental effect on retinopathy or nephropathy. However, pregnancy poses a risk for women with established cardiovascular disease, particularly in older women and those with a long duration of disease. This risk should be discussed with women before pregnancy. Women who develop diabetes in pregnancy are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in middle age.
----
[RETINOPATHY IN PREGNANCY]
Diabetic retinopathy is more common in women with type 1 diabetes of childbearing age than type 2 diabetes. Retinopathy may progress during pregnancy, especially in women with moderate or severe retinopathy before pregnancy. However, it rarely has a long-term detrimental effect on the natural history or progression of diabetic retinopathy. Baseline retinopathy status is the only independent risk factor that predicts later progression of retinopathy.
----
[RETINOPATHY PROGRESSION IN PREGNANCY]
Retinopathy can develop de novo in pregnancy, although this is unlikely to progress to proliferative retinopathy. Progression to proliferative retinopathy is also uncommon among women with mild or minimal retinopathy at booking. Laser treatment before pregnancy protects against proliferative changes in pregnancy. Hypertension can influence retinopathy progression, and women with more advanced retinopathy at booking and longer duration of diabetes are more likely to experience progression.
----
[NEONATAL COMPLICATIONS]
Neonatal complications of diabetic pregnancies include polycythemia, respiratory distress syndrome, and transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The current NICE guidelines recommend the use of intravenous glucose to treat neonatal hypoglycemia only when there are clinical signs of hypoglycemia or a persistent blood sugar < 2.0 mmol/L that cannot be raised by oral or tube feeding. Intravenous glucose should be continued until the glucose is > 2.5 mmol/L.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
Women with diabetes and macroalbuminuria or proteinuria are at increased risk of accelerated deterioration of renal function during pregnancy, which can also affect fetal health. The risk of proteinuria and pre-eclampsia increases with increasing proteinuria and declining kidney function. Pre-pregnancy advice from a specialist is crucial for women with high protein excretion or serum creatinine concentration to discuss the risks and management of diabetic nephropathy.

----
[DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY MANAGEMENT]
Women with diabetic nephropathy require realistic and current information on their kidney disease to make informed choices about their health and motherhood. Early intensive management of hypertension can lessen the risk of preterm birth, very low birth weight, and neonatal hypoglycemia associated with diabetic nephropathy. Regular monitoring and specialist care can help improve outcomes for both the mother and the child.

----
[RENAL TRANSPLANTATION AND PREGNANCY]
The number of women with diabetes undergoing renal or combined renal-pancreatic transplantation is increasing, and successful pregnancies following transplantation are becoming more common. However, there is still an increased risk of miscarriages, stillbirths, and other complications, highlighting the importance of optimal blood pressure control and careful management during pregnancy.

----
[RETINOPATHY PROGRESSION IN PREGNANCY]
Poor glycemic control in early pregnancy and rapid improvement of glycemic control can be associated with retinopathy progression. Studies have shown that women with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of retinopathy deterioration during pregnancy, especially if they have been switched to intensive insulin therapy. Regular eye exams and careful management of blood sugar levels are essential to minimize the risk of retinopathy progression.
----
[OBESITY IN DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY]
Obesity is a common co-morbidity in women with diabetes, affecting not only women with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes but also an increasing number of women with type 1 diabetes. Maternal and infant mortality, as well as the risk of congenital malformations and stillbirth, increase with rising maternal BMI. Obesity also increases the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and other complications during pregnancy.
----
[COMPLICATIONS OF OBESITY IN DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY]
The risk of congenital malformations, such as neural tube defects and heart defects, is higher in babies born to obese mothers with diabetes. Additionally, obesity increases the risk of birth trauma, adult obesity, and diabetes in the offspring. Even achieving euglycemia may not fully protect obese women with diabetes against the added risk of congenital malformations.
----
[AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Women with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of other autoimmune diseases, particularly thyroid disease and celiac disease. Monitoring thyroid function is essential in pregnant women with hypothyroidism, as small increases in thyroxine replacement are frequently required. Autoimmune diseases can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and preterm births.
----
[RENAL TRANSPLANTATION AND PREGNANCY IN WOMEN WITH DIABETES]
Pregnancy in women with renal transplants is possible, with live birth rates approaching 80% in the UK. However, pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and other complications. Close monitoring of serum creatinine levels and blood pressure is essential to minimize the risk of adverse effects on the transplant and the fetus.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF PRE-PREGNANCY CARE]
Accessing pre-pregnancy care is crucial for women with diabetes, as it can help optimize glycemic control, reduce pregnancy risks, and improve outcomes. However, attendance at pre-pregnancy clinics can be low, with some studies suggesting that only 30-80% of women with diabetes attend these clinics. Women who seek out pre-pregnancy care tend to have higher educational and economic status and greater family and social support.
----
[PRE-PREGNANCY CARE COVERAGE]
Pre-pregnancy care should cover topics such as the benefits of optimal glycemic control, folic acid supplementation, lifestyle advice, diet and exercise, safe prescription medications, and pregnancy risks to the woman's and fetus's health. The advice should be constructive, non-judgmental, and communicated in a way that is appropriate for the individual woman. This information can help women with diabetes make informed decisions about their care during pregnancy.
----
[BENEFITS OF OPTIMAL GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Optimal glycemic control prior to conception can improve pregnancy outcomes and reduce the risk of congenital malformations. Women with diabetes should be encouraged to achieve optimal glycemic control before conception, and healthcare providers should emphasize the benefits of good glycemic control on pregnancy outcomes. Pre-pregnancy care can help women achieve optimal glycemic control, which can reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
----
[CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF PRE-PREGNANCY CARE]
Pregnancy care for women with diabetes should begin prior to conception, with a focus on optimizing glycemic control, reviewing medication, and starting folic acid supplementation. Healthcare providers should emphasize the benefits of pre-pregnancy planning and good glycemic control on pregnancy outcomes, and encourage women to plan their pregnancies. Regular monitoring and management of thyroid function and other health conditions can also help reduce pregnancy risks and improve outcomes.
----
[PRE-PREGNANCY HBA1C TARGETS]
The recommended pre-pregnancy HbA1c targets vary by country, with the USA and Australia recommending a target of <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) and the UK recommending a target of <6.1% (<43 mmol/mol) if safely possible. These targets are important for reducing the risk of congenital malformations. Individual HbA1c targets should be set and discussed with the woman concerned.

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK IN PREGNANCY]
The risk of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness increases during pregnancy, especially in women with Type 1 diabetes. Women with Type 1 diabetes should be taught to adjust their insulin dosage according to their dietary carbohydrate intake to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. Advice on hypoglycemia risk should be given to women receiving insulin.

----
[FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTATION]
Folic acid supplementation is recommended for all women planning a pregnancy, with a dose of 5mg recommended for women with diabetes due to the higher risk of neural tube defects (NTD). A folate-rich diet plus 400μg/day folic acid should be taken from before conception until 12 weeks of pregnancy.

----
[LIFESTYLE ADVICE FOR PREGNANCY]
Smoking in pregnancy is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and women seeking pregnancy should be given advice and help to stop smoking. Preconception care has been shown to reduce the risk of congenital anomalies, with a meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies finding a lower relative risk of anomalies with preconception care.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN PREGNANCY]
Women with diabetes should be informed of the need for extra surveillance and antenatal care as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. This includes additional clinic attendances, fetal monitoring, and ultrasound scanning to assess fetal viability and growth. The goal is to optimize glycemic control and minimize risks to the mother and fetus.

----
[SCREENING FOR DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS]
Screening for diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy is important before pregnancy to assess if any treatment is required. Women with diabetes should be informed of the importance of retinal screening, and those with known proliferative retinopathy should be considered for laser treatment prior to pregnancy. Regular retinal screening is recommended during pregnancy, with a first trimester screen and repeat screens at 28 weeks and 16-20 weeks if retinopathy is present.

----
[RETINOPATHY MANAGEMENT IN PREGNANCY]
Women with retinopathy in pregnancy should be aware that retinal follow-up should continue for at least 6 months postpartum. Rapid intensification of glycemic control can worsen retinopathy, emphasizing the importance of optimizing glycemic control prior to pregnancy. Tropicamide to dilate the eye and photocoagulation therapy are safe in pregnancy if required.

----
[PRE-PREGNANCY CARE AND LIFESTYLE ADVICE]
Pre-pregnancy care is a time to provide dietary information and advice on exercise to optimize glycemic control and minimize hypoglycemia. Obese women should be encouraged to achieve a healthy weight prior to pregnancy through diet and exercise if they have a BMI > 27 kg/m2. Women with diabetes should also be advised to avoid alcohol, especially in the first 3 months of pregnancy, as it can increase the risk of hypoglycemia and miscarriage.

----
[SAFE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS IN PREGNANCY]
The use of oral hypoglycemic agents other than metformin and glibenclamide is not recommended in pregnancy. Women on oral hypoglycemic therapy during pre-pregnancy care should be switched to insulin if their HbA1c values are above target, although metformin can be continued. Calcium-channel blockers may be safe in pregnancy, but other antihypertensive agents should be used on an individual basis, weighing the risks and benefits.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN PREGNANCY]
In clinical practice, achieving normoglycemia in pregnant women with diabetes is challenging due to the high risk of severe hypoglycemia and growth restriction in the fetus. Women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) require frequent glucose monitoring and flexible insulin dosing to balance insulin requirements with physiologic changes of pregnancy. This can be achieved through a basal bolus regimen or insulin pump. 
----
[INSULIN REQUIREMENTS IN PREGNANCY]
Insulin requirements for women with T1DM usually fall in the first trimester before rising in the mid-second trimester. This initial increase in insulin sensitivity occurs at a time when there is a physiologic fall in fasting blood glucose, making women with T1DM extremely susceptible to hypoglycemia. 
----
[RISK OF HYPOGLYCEMIA IN PREGNANCY]
The risk of hypoglycemia is high in pregnant women with T1DM, with approximately 45% of women experiencing severe hypoglycemic events requiring third-party assistance. Predictors for severe hypoglycemia include a history of similar events, impaired hypoglycemia awareness, and long duration of T1DM. 
----
[SCREENING FOR NEPHROPATHY IN PREGNANCY]
Women with diabetes who are actively seeking pregnancy should be screened for microalbuminuria and have their serum creatinine measured. Those with normal urinary ACR and serum creatinine can be reassured that their kidney function poses no added risk to the pregnancy, while those with microalbuminuria need to be aware of the increased risk for hypertension and pre-eclampsia.
----
[GLYCEMIC TARGETS IN PREGNANCY]
Glycemic targets for pregnancy are set by national guidelines and are the same for all women with diabetes, regardless of type. However, these targets need to be adjusted and discussed individually according to what is safe and achievable for the woman. The current targets for the UK are fasting blood glucose of 3.5 – 5.9 mmol/L and 1 hour post-prandial blood glucose < 7.8 mmol/L, if safely achievable.
----
[GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT IN GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
In women with gestational diabetes (GDM), active glycemic management with diet, exercise, and insulin, if required, is associated with less perinatal morbidity. The targets for GDM are a fasting blood glucose < 5.5 mmol/L and a 2-hour post-prandial level < 7.0 mmol/L. However, too stringent targets for glycemic control in women with GDM may be potentially detrimental for the infant.
----
[INSULIN MANAGEMENT IN PREGNANCY]
Women with pre-gestational diabetes who are not using an insulin pump usually require multiple daily injections (MDI) with either short-acting human insulin or quick-acting analog insulin. The use of MDI regimens is recommended by both US and UK guidelines, as it is associated with better glycemic control and less neonatal hypoglycemia.
----
[SAFETY OF INSULIN ANALOGS IN PREGNANCY]
There are theoretical concerns around the use of insulin analogs in pregnancy, but quick-acting insulin analogs have been widely used in diabetic pregnancy for over 10 years without any evidence of harm. They are recommended in both the US and UK guidelines, but their use puts greater emphasis on the need for accurate glucose monitoring.
----
[RISK OF HYPOGLYCEMIA IN PREGNANCY]
The risk of severe hypoglycemia is less after the first 22 weeks of pregnancy, but maternal mortality from hypoglycemia is extremely rare and well recognized. All women intensively managed with insulin need to be informed of the added risk of hypoglycemia in pregnancy and given advice to minimize the risk.
----
[GLUCOSE MONITORING IN PREGNANCY]
Accurate self-monitoring of blood glucose is required at least four times a day for women with diabetes in pregnancy, but the content was truncated and more information is needed to complete this section.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
Diabetes in pregnancy requires careful management, with insulin glargine being commonly used prior to pregnancy and stopped at booking in some cases. Insulin aspart, lispro, and human soluble insulin are also used as bolus insulins. The long-acting analog insulin detemir may be a more appropriate basal insulin analog than glargine due to its lower affinity binding to the IGF-I receptor.
----
[CONTINUOUS SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN INFUSION PUMPS]
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps (CSII) offer a physiologic form of subcutaneous insulin administration and are being increasingly used in pregnancy. However, there are no adequately powered multicentered studies evaluating their use in pregnancy, and clinical experience is still growing. CSII may improve overall control and glycemic fluctuations in selected women with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes.
----
[INSULIN THERAPY IN PREGNANCY]
Multiple daily insulin (MDI) regimens with insulin analogs are attractive options for diabetic pregnancies, as they are associated with less nocturnal hypoglycemia and allow for more flexible dosing. Rapid-acting insulin analogs are being increasingly used by patients who carbohydrate count and adjust their insulin dose. The use of insulin analogs prior to pregnancy is becoming more common, and switching to older human soluble insulin in early pregnancy may put women at risk of poor glycemic control.
----
[CLINICAL STUDIES ON INSULIN PUMPS IN PREGNANCY]
Systematic reviews and randomized trials have shown no significant differences in pregnancy outcomes or glycemic control between CSII and MDI. However, more good quality studies are required to determine which women would benefit from CSII in pregnancy. Large multicentered randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of CSII in pregnancy and to identify the most suitable candidates for this treatment.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN PREGNANCY]
Women with diabetes require extra maternal and fetal surveillance in pregnancy, in addition to routine antenatal care. The management of pregnant women with pre-gestational diabetes varies according to country, but the principles of management are broadly similar. Early optimization of glycemic control is crucial, especially for women with type 2 diabetes who may be starting insulin for the first time. Frequent contact with the multidisciplinary team is necessary to achieve this goal.
----
[ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS IN PREGNANCY]
The use of oral hypoglycemic agents in the management of diabetic pregnancies remains controversial, with the ADA not currently recommending their use, while the UK NICE guidelines endorse the use of metformin in combination with insulin for women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes. Metformin and glibenclamide are also recommended for the management of gestational diabetes. However, only sulfonylureas and metformin have been sufficiently evaluated in pregnancy.
----
[DIETARY ADVICE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WITH DIABETES]
The general advice around diet for pregnant women with diabetes remains the same as for non-diabetic pregnancies, with the ADA guidelines recommending 175g/day digestible carbohydrate and 28g/day fiber. Women should be advised to spread their carbohydrate intake and take appropriate food choices as snacks to prevent and manage hypoglycemia. Exercise advice should be individualized, with a general principle of at least 30 minutes/day of moderate intensity physical activity.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY PREGNANCY CARE]
Early pregnancy care is crucial for women with diabetes, with all women being seen at the earliest opportunity once pregnancy is confirmed. This allows for the review of prescribed and over-the-counter medications, optimization of glycemic control, and confirmation of viability of the pregnancy at 6-8 weeks. This information is essential for assessing fetal growth and determining the optimal timing of birth.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY SURVEILLANCE]
Fetal surveillance for cardiac anomalies using ultrasonography should be performed at 18-22 weeks, in addition to a routine detailed anatomical scan for other congenital anomalies. This scan should examine the four heart chambers, as well as the outflow tract of the aorta and pulmonary artery. Repeat digital retinal photographs should be performed at 16 weeks' gestation for women who had an abnormal retinal screen in the first trimester.
----
[SECOND TRIMESTER COMPLICATIONS]
The second trimester is associated with worsening hypertension in women with pre-existing hypertension and the development of pregnancy-induced hypertension in women with microalbuminuria. This trimester is also associated with minor complications of pregnancy, such as vaginal candidiasis, heartburn, urinary tract infections, and carpal tunnel syndrome, which can be exacerbated by diabetes.
----
[THIRD TRIMESTER CARE]
Optimizing glycemic control continues to be important in the third trimester due to the risk of stillbirth and accelerated fetal growth. Serial ultrasound scans to assess fetal growth and liquor volume should start at 28 weeks and be repeated at 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. Maternal surveillance in the third trimester includes further digital retinal photographs and regular checks for hypertension and pre-eclampsia.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES SCREENING]
Glucose intolerance developing de novo in pregnancy usually manifests itself by 26-28 weeks' gestation. The ADA and NICE guidelines recommend selecting women to screen for gestational diabetes according to maternal risk factors, using a diagnostic 75-g OGTT.
----
[NUTRITION AND WEIGHT GAIN IN PREGNANCY]
Women with diabetes should aim to manage their carbohydrate intake, with low-glycemic index carbohydrates potentially preventing glycemic excursions. The actual additional calories required to sustain a pregnancy are modest, approximately 100 kcal in the first trimester rising to 200-300 kcal in the third trimester. Appropriate weight gain targets should be given to women at the start of pregnancy, taking into account their BMI and diabetes status.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY MANAGEMENT]
Current UK obstetric guidelines recommend offering induction of labor after 38 completed weeks or an elective cesarean section to women with pre-gestational and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus emphasizes the importance of estimated fetal weight in deciding the timing and mode of delivery. A randomized controlled trial found that induction of labor reduced the risk of shoulder dystocia and large for gestational age infants compared to expectant management.
----
[PRETERM BIRTH RATES IN DIABETIC PREGNANCIES]
The preterm birth rate is increased in diabetic pregnancies, with 35.8% of births being preterm compared to 7.4% in the general maternity population. Recognized risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery in women with diabetes include pre-eclampsia, nephropathy, poor glycemic control, and obesity. Steroids are often given to mothers at risk of preterm birth to accelerate fetal lung maturity, but their use can worsen glycemic control.
----
[GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR]
There is an association between maternal hyperglycemia during labor and neonatal hypoglycemia. Therefore, it is essential to manage glycemic levels during labor. The use of steroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity can worsen glycemic control, and proactive management with insulin doses or insulin infusion may be necessary.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS DIAGNOSIS]
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend an initial 50-g glucose challenge test at 24-28 weeks, followed by a diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) if the challenge test is positive. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are used to establish the diagnosis of GDM.
----
[DIABETES IN PREGNANCY]
Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at increased risk of developing diabetes in the future, with the majority developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and a smaller minority developing type 1 diabetes (T1DM).

Poor glucose control may lead to cognitive impairment, which can recover with improved glycemic control. Cognitive dysfunction in older subjects with diabetes has significant implications, including increased hospitalization and reduced ability for self-care.

----
[DEPRESSION IN DIABETES]
Depression is a serious co-morbidity in diabetes, associated with poor outcomes and high healthcare expenditure. The presence of a major depressive disorder significantly increases the risk of diabetes, and depression is a significant indicator of subsequent death in people with diabetes. Failure to recognize depression can have serious consequences, damaging quality of life and increasing the risk of coronary heart disease and arterial disease.

----
[CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN DIABETES]
Cardiovascular diseases, such as angina, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and stroke, are more common in elderly subjects with diabetes than in age-matched control groups without diabetes. Many elderly patients with diabetes may present with atypical symptoms, including "silent ischemia," which carries a worse prognosis than in the non-diabetic population.

----
[ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN DIABETES]
Erectile dysfunction is more common in older adults with diabetes, affecting 55-95% of men with diabetes after 60 years of age. Vasculopathy, autonomic neuropathy, hormonal dysregulation, and psychogenic factors have been implicated in the development of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes. Investigation and treatment should proceed as for younger men, with options including oral sildenaﬁl, vacuum tumescence devices, and misoprostol urethral pellets.
----
[DIABETES IN OLDER ADULTS]
Chronic diabetic complications often cause considerable disability in older people, with common problems including visual impairment and previous amputation. A community-based survey found significant disability in 80% of elderly inner-city patients with diabetes, with a mean age of 73 years. Older people with diabetes also had significantly lower levels of well-being and increased levels of physical and cognitive disability.

----
[DISABILITY AND MORTALITY IN OLDER ADULTS WITH DIABETES]
People with diabetes die prematurely, mostly from cardiovascular disease, with a higher incidence of premature death in older subjects with diabetes. Cardiovascular mortality accounts for 42% of the overall mortality in older adults with diabetes. Age remains the strongest predictor of mortality, and long-term metabolic control is a better predictor of outcome than classic cardiovascular risk factors.

----
[DIABETES AND DEPRESSION IN OLDER ADULTS]
The relationship between diabetes and depression is complex and may result from the presence of a chronic medical condition in a susceptible individual. Diabetes and depression share similar symptomatology, which may delay or confuse the diagnosis. Enquiries about well-being, sleep, appetite, and weight loss should be part of the routine history, with a more comprehensive psychiatric evaluation if appropriate. A Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score of > 5 can be regarded as indicative of probable depression.
----
[DIABETES IN ELDERLY WOMEN]
Normal fasting glucose levels (< 7.0 mmol/L) in elderly women are associated with increased fatal cardiovascular disease and heart disease. Elderly patients may have hyperglycemia due to acute illness, diabetogenic therapy, or other stress-inducing disorders. The HbA1c test can help identify these cases, and retesting after an acute illness may prevent false diagnoses. 
----
[MANAGING DIABETES IN THE ELDERLY]
Elderly patients with diabetes should be treated as rigorously as younger subjects, with a comprehensive set of evidence-based clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes in older people. Approaches such as the five-step evaluation can help shape the content of the care package, targeting the individual's problems effectively. 
----
[CLINICAL FEATURES OF DIABETES IN THE ELDERLY]
The presentation of diabetes in older people is varied and often insidious, which may delay diagnosis. Many cases are detected by finding hyperglycemia during investigation for co-morbidities or acute illnesses. Some patients may present with a "mixed" disturbance of moderate hyperglycemia and modest acidosis, but without marked dehydration or altered consciousness. 
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES IN THE ELDERLY]
Diagnostic criteria for diabetes in the elderly are the same as in younger subjects. However, mortality may be higher in those diagnosed with diabetes based on a 2-hour glucose value than with fasting criteria alone. Isolated post-load hyperglycemia with normal fasting glucose levels can also be a diagnostic challenge. 
----
[FRAILTY MODEL OF DIABETES]
The Frailty Model of Diabetes can assist clinical decision-making by defining factors that may herald disability and threaten independence, such as recurrent hypoglycemia, cardiac disease, and reduced recovery from metabolic decompensation. Identifying "frail" patients is crucial in developing effective care strategies to reduce morbidity and disability.
----
[DIABETES CARE IN OLDER ADULTS]
Diabetes care in older adults aims to achieve strict glycemic and blood pressure control, while also considering lipid lowering therapy. The goal is to optimize glucose and blood pressure control, while avoiding hypoglycemia and excessive monitoring. Symptom control is also a key consideration in older adults with diabetes.

----
[FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENTS IN OLDER ADULTS]
Functional assessments are important in older adults with diabetes, as they can help guide treatment aims. Older adults may be relatively independent, have some evidence of functional decline, or be highly dependent and frail. Matching treatment aims to functional assessments can help improve outcomes in older adults with diabetes.

----
[TREATMENT TARGETS FOR OLDER ADULTS]
Treatment targets for older adults with diabetes include metabolic and cardiovascular targets, such as glycemic control and blood pressure management. The European Guidelines provide a series of glycemic targets to guide treatment, including a target HbA1c of < 64 mmol/mol (8.0%) in frailer subjects. Lipid-lowering therapy should also be considered for subjects up to the age of 80 years.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL TARGETS]
Glycemic control targets for older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) vary depending on the individual's cardiovascular risk, presence of microvascular complications, and ability to self-manage. A target HbA1c range of 7.0-7.5% is recommended for older patients with T2DM and single system involvement, while a fasting glucose range of 6.5-7.5 mmol/L can be regarded as indicating good control.

----
[LIPID-LOWERING THERAPY]
Lipid-lowering therapy should be considered for older adults with diabetes up to the age of 80 years. This can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as thromboembolic events. Aspirin therapy (75 mg/day) may also be considered for thromboembolic prophylaxis.
----
[DIABETES AND STATIN THERAPY]
The Heart Protection Study found that treating adults with diabetes aged 40-80 years with 40mg simvastatin led to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 27% reduction in the incidence of non-fatal MI or coronary death. This study also showed a 25% reduction in non-fatal or fatal stroke. The benefits of treatment were observed as early as 12 months. 
----
[ANTIHYPERTENSIVE REGIMENS IN DIABETES]
A clinical trial comparing different antihypertensive regimens found that an amlodipine-based regimen had significant benefits on mortality in subjects with type 2 diabetes, including a 25% reduction in fatal and non-fatal strokes, 48% reduction in peripheral vascular disease, and 57% reduction in non-coronary revascularization procedures.
----

The Micro-HOPE study found that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as ramipril, can improve cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes, reducing primary endpoints like stroke, MI, and all-cause mortality by 24%.
----
[TIGHTER GLUCOSE REGULATION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Recent studies have shown that tighter glucose regulation in type 2 diabetes may not necessarily reduce cardiovascular outcomes, and may even increase the risk of hypoglycemia. The optimal level of HbA1c to aim for in older patients with type 2 diabetes is still unclear.
----
[MANAGEMENT OF OLDER PATIENTS WITH DIABETES]
The management of older patients with diabetes poses several dilemmas, including how to reduce cardiovascular risk and what the optimal level of HbA1c is to aim for. For now, clinicians should aim for realistic targets similar to those for younger adults, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia.
----
[ANTIPLATELET THERAPY IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH DIABETES]
Antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin or clopidogrel, is appropriate in older subjects with diabetes and macrovascular disease or risk factors, but there is no specific evidence to support full warfarin anticoagulation in this age group.
----
[DIABETES MEDICATIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS]
For older adults with diabetes, sulfonylureas like tolbutamide can be used, carrying a low risk of hypoglycemia, especially in those with mild renal impairment. However, they may not be effective for patients with very high glucose levels. Metformin is also a suitable option, being predictable and safe when used correctly, with advantages including no risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain. 
----
[METFORMIN USAGE AND EFFECTIVENESS]
Metformin's contraindications include renal impairment, hepatic or cardiac failure, and severe acute illness, making it ineligible for about 40-50% of older subjects. Its glucose-lowering effect is similar to sulfonylureas, and it has been shown to reduce macrovascular events and all-cause mortality in obese subjects. The usual daily dose required is approximately 1.7g, and it is effective in both lean and overweight individuals.
----
[ACARBOSE AND ITS USAGE]
Acarbose has a weak hypoglycemic effect and can cause gastrointestinal side effects like bloating and flatulence, which can be diminished by slow introduction of the drug. It can be combined with metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin, but its main contraindications are inflammatory bowel disease and subacute obstruction.
----
[MANAGING DIABETES IN OLDER ADULTS]
The principal aims of managing diabetes in older adults include creating an initial diabetes care plan, which may change with time or the development of complications. Lifestyle modification, including dietary and lifestyle advice, is also crucial, and active management of other cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidemia is necessary from the outset.
----
[SULFONYLUREAS AND THEIR HAZARDS]
Sulfonylureas are often used initially in elderly people with diabetes, but their main hazard is hypoglycemia, which can be a particular problem with certain types like glibenclamide and glipizide. These should be strictly avoided or used with caution in the elderly due to the risk of hypoglycemic deaths.
----
[REPAGLINIDE AND NATEGLINIDE]
Repaglinide is a meglitinide that is safe in mild to moderate renal impairment and can be effectively combined with metformin and thiazolidinediones. It is initially given at 0.5 mg with each meal, increasing to 4 mg with each meal. Nateglinide is a recent meglitinide with a faster and shorter duration of insulin secretory activity than repaglinide, but is less effective as monotherapy or in combination. 
----
[INSULIN TREATMENT IN OLDER PEOPLE]
Insulin is used in the treatment of older people with diabetes, particularly those with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes who have not achieved metabolic targets with diet, exercise, and oral agents. The main disadvantage of insulin is hypoglycemia, although reported benefits include improvements in well-being and quality of life, and in cognitive function. Rapidly acting insulin analogs such as insulin lispro or insulin aspart may cause less hypoglycemia and weight gain. 
----
[THIAZOLIDINEDIONES]
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) reduce insulin resistance by activating the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR γ), lowering glucose by 3-4 mmol/L and reducing HbA1c by 5-15 mmol/mol (0.5-1.4%) as monotherapy. However, they can cause mild edema, dilutional anemia, and weight gain, and are contraindicated in heart failure. TZDs can be given in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, and glinides, and pioglitazone can be given with insulin. 
----
[NON-SULFONYLUREA INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES]
Repaglinide is a benzoic acid derivative of the meglitinide class that predominantly lowers post-prandial hyperglycemia, with a rapid onset of action and a lower risk of hypoglycemia than sulfonylureas. It achieves better post-prandial glucose profiles and can be given with each meal, with an initial dose of 0.5 mg increasing to 4 mg as needed.
----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN CARE HOMES]
Diabetes management in care homes should include screening for diabetes on admission and regularly thereafter, as well as policies to minimize hospital admission and diabetes-related complications. Care-home diabetes policies should be developed nationally, locally, and at the level of the resident with diabetes. All residents with diabetes should have an annual review and access to specialist services.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY IN OLDER PATIENTS]
In older patients with type 1 diabetes, premixed insulins given twice daily may achieve reasonable glycemic control, although nocturnal hypoglycemia may be troublesome. In older patients with type 2 diabetes, a twice-daily regimen of human isophane insulin can be used, adding short-acting insulin to cover meals if necessary. Long-acting insulin analogs, such as insulin glargine and insulin detemir, may prove safer in older subjects due to their more reproducible pharmacokinetics and "peakless" action profile.

----
[COMBINED THERAPY FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Insulin can be combined with an oral agent in patients failing to be controlled by diet and oral agents. A suitable regimen is a night-time dose of intermediate-acting insulin, such as isophane, together with metformin, which causes less weight gain and hypoglycemia and better glycemic control than twice-daily insulin or combinations of glibenclamide with insulin or metformin.

----
[DIABETES PREVALENCE IN CARE HOMES]
The prevalence of diabetes in care homes is increasing, with recent surveys suggesting that 7-27% of care-home residents in the UK and USA have diabetes.

[INFLAMMATORY MECHANISMS]
Inflammation and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may mediate the association between depression and diabetes, with associated perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This can lead to increased levels of cytokines, which may interfere with insulin action and contribute to the development of diabetes.

----
[COUNTER-REGULATORY HORMONES]
Acute psychologic stress can increase circulating concentrations of counter-regulatory hormones, including noradrenaline, glucocorticoids, and growth hormone, which can antagonize the hypoglycemic action of insulin. Chronic stress can also lead to changes in the HPA axis, which may contribute to the development of depression and diabetes.

----
[DEPRESSION AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
There is an association between the severity of depressive symptoms and the level of glycemic control, as assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c). Studies have shown that individuals with depression are more likely to have poor glycemic control, although the size of this effect is generally modest and may be influenced by confounding factors.

----
[DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS AS A RISK FACTOR FOR DIABETES]
Depressive disorders may be a risk factor for the development of diabetes, with some studies suggesting that the onset of diabetes may follow a depressive episode. However, this association may be influenced by ascertainment bias, and further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between depression and diabetes.
----
[DIAGNOSING PSYCHOLOGIC DISORDERS IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
Healthcare professionals should have the necessary skills to diagnose and manage non-severe psychologic disorders in diabetes patients from diverse cultural backgrounds. They should be knowledgeable about counseling techniques, drug therapy, and when to refer patients to specialists. Several short screening questionnaires, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), can be used to identify psychologic difficulties.
----
[SCREENING FOR DEPRESSION IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
A brief clinical interview using three questions can be an effective way to screen for depression in diabetes patients. The questions include: "During the past month, have you been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?" and "During the past month, have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?" If the patient answers "yes" to either question and wants help, treatment can be offered.
----
[DEPRESSION AND DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
There is a significant association between depression and the risk of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications in diabetes patients. Additionally, the presence of depression may worsen glycemic control and self-care, leading to an increased risk of complications. Peripheral neuropathic pain is a complication that may have a particular association with depression.
----
[MANAGING DEPRESSION IN DIABETES PATIENTS]
The primary goals of managing depression in diabetes patients are to reduce depressive symptoms, improve self-care, and enhance glycemic control and diabetes outcomes. While treatment studies are limited, evidence suggests that improving glycemic control can lead to a reduction in depressive symptoms. Clinics can provide "first response" management for simple depressive disorders, but specialist help may be required for more complex cases.
----
[PSYCHOLOGIC TREATMENT FOR DIABETES]
Psychologic treatment is an important aspect of management for depression in diabetic populations, which can take various forms, including cognitive-behavior therapy and educational approaches. These interventions can improve glycemic control and reduce psychologic distress, with a modest effect size equivalent to a reduction in HbA1c of around 0.6% (7 mmol/mol). However, the boundary between educative approaches and formal psychotherapy has become blurred, making it difficult to evaluate the available literature. The consensus from systematic reviews is that such interventions can be beneficial.

----
[EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Educational approaches for diabetes management can be broadly divided into "didactic" and "enhanced" forms, with the latter supplementing information and advice with behavioral instruction, problem-solving skills, and techniques such as biofeedback or relaxation. These approaches can improve glycemic control and reduce psychologic distress, but the effectiveness of these interventions can vary. The goal of these approaches is to improve knowledge and understanding of diabetes management, as well as address more complex causes of suboptimal self-care.

----
[PSYCHOLOGIC TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION IN DIABETES]
There is a need for more evaluation of the benefits and applicability of psychologic treatments for depression in people with diabetes, as they are potentially very effective but expensive and limited in availability. Studies have shown that cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and cognitive-analytic therapy can be beneficial in reducing psychologic distress and improving long-term glycemic control. However, the availability of such treatments to people with diabetes is actually decreasing in some areas, highlighting the need for initiatives to widen access to these treatments.

----
[PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS IN DIABETES]
Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, are serious forms of illness that can affect people with diabetes, and are often referred to as "severe mental illness" (SMI). These disorders can have a significant impact on diabetes management and overall health, and require careful consideration and treatment. The management of psychotic disorders in people with diabetes requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the complex interplay between mental health and diabetes management.

----
[ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS FOR DIABETES]
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly used as first-choice agents for treating depression in people with diabetes, but caution is needed due to potential drug-drug interactions with oral hypoglycemic agents. For example, the use of fluoxetine may lead to hypoglycemia, and weight gain associated with some antidepressants, such as mirtazepine, can be particularly undesirable in overweight people with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits of antidepressant medications is necessary when treating people with diabetes.
----
[PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND DIABETES]
Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can have a significant impact on patients' well-being and functioning, particularly when they co-occur with a chronic physical illness like diabetes. These disorders can create significant management challenges, and patients with both psychiatric and physical illnesses are among the most complex cases in healthcare systems. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism are more common in individuals with mental illnesses, and some treatments for these disorders may also affect metabolic health.

----
[COMORBIDITY OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND DIABETES]
Patients with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have reduced life expectancy, with much of the excess early mortality resulting from physical diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Intensified efforts to improve the physical health of people with long-term mental illness are now underway, with detection and management of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes at their core. This highlights the importance of addressing comorbidities in patients with psychiatric disorders to improve overall health outcomes.

[IMPACT OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS ON DAILY FUNCTIONING]
Psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia can have marked effects on daily functioning, including cognitive decline, disorganization of speech and behavior, and negative symptoms such as loss of drive and blunting of affect. These symptoms can affect various aspects of daily life, including occupational, interpersonal, and self-care activities. The impact of these disorders on overall functioning is profound, making it essential to provide comprehensive care that addresses both physical and mental health needs.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS]
Diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are complex and involve various symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms. The DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, for example, require two or more symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for providing effective treatment and management of these disorders.
----
[DIABETES RISK IN PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS]
People with psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, have an increased risk of developing diabetes. This association has been observed in studies dating back to the early 20th century, and has been supplemented by more recent research on drug-naïve patients. The exact nature of this association is still not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including the disease itself, its treatment, and lifestyle factors.

----
[PREMATURE MORTALITY IN PSYCHOTIC ILLNESSES]
Individuals with psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, have a higher risk of premature mortality compared to the general population. This increased mortality is due to a range of factors, including suicide, accidents, and natural causes, with the latter accounting for the majority of excess mortality. Lifestyle factors, such as smoking, physical inactivity, and poor diet, also contribute to this increased risk.

----
[COMORBIDITY OF DIABETES AND BIPOLAR ILLNESS]
There is growing evidence that patients with bipolar illness have an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease compared to the general population. The use of antipsychotic drugs, which are commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder, may also contribute to this increased risk, particularly with long-term use. Other medications used to treat bipolar disorder, such as lithium and sodium valproate, have been associated with weight gain, but their wider metabolic effects are not yet fully understood.

----
[CHALLENGES IN INTERPRETING STUDY FINDINGS]
Interpreting the findings of studies on the association between psychotic disorders and diabetes is challenging due to the presence of confounding variables, such as lifestyle differences and the effects of treatments. Disentangling the risks associated with the disease, its treatment, and genetic and lifestyle factors is particularly difficult, and requires careful consideration of the complex interplay between these factors.
----
[DIABETES RISK FACTORS IN MENTAL ILLNESS]
Traditional risk factors for diabetes, such as family history, low birth weight, obesity, diet, and exercise, contribute to the development of diabetes in people with serious mental illness. Additionally, antipsychotic medication, particularly atypical antipsychotics, increases the risk of developing diabetes. The relative contributions of these factors vary, with schizophrenia and antipsychotic medication playing a significant role. 
----
[PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA]
The prevalence of diabetes in people with schizophrenia is higher than in the general population, with a two- to fourfold increase in risk. Most patients with schizophrenia have type 2 diabetes, and the overall prevalence of diabetes is estimated to be 10-15% in Western populations. The onset of diabetes appears to occur around 10-20 years earlier in people with serious mental illness than in the general population.
----
[COMPARISON OF DIABETES PREVALENCE ACROSS AGE GROUPS]
The age-specific prevalence rates of diabetes in people with schizophrenia are higher than in the general US population, with significant numbers of people with diabetes under the age of 40. This suggests that diabetes should not be ignored, even in those with a recent diagnosis of mental illness. The prevalence of diabetes increases with age, but people with schizophrenia are at a higher risk of developing diabetes at a younger age.
----
[DIABETES RISK IN BIPOLAR DISORDER]
There is a suggestion in the literature that patients with bipolar disorder are also at increased risk of developing diabetes, with a relative risk estimated at two- to threefold. However, more systematic studies are needed to confirm this association, and similar caveats about the effects of treatments and lifestyle differences apply.
----
[DIABETES RISK IN SPECIAL GROUPS]
People with psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar illness, have a higher risk of developing diabetes due to various factors, including genetic associations, poor diet, lower physical activity, and higher rates of smoking. The risk of diabetes in these populations is further increased by the use of antipsychotic medications, which can induce weight gain and increase the risk of developing diabetes. The true risk of diabetes in these populations is difficult to determine due to the complexities of observational and randomized studies.

----
[METABOLIC SYNDROME AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH]
Patients with psychotic disorders often have elevated cardiovascular risk factors, including intermediate hyperglycemia and metabolic syndrome, which increase the emphasis on the importance of cardiovascular health promotion in these populations. The metabolic health of people with psychotic disorders is a wide-ranging public health issue that requires consideration of lifestyle advice, early detection of risk factors, screening for clinical disease, and treatment for established disease.

----
[MECHANISMS OF DIABETES ASSOCIATION]
The association between psychotic illness and diabetes is complex and multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Shared susceptibility loci, poorer diet, lower physical activity, and higher rates of smoking may contribute to the observed association. Additionally, the activation of the HPA axis by stress associated with mental illness and the use of antipsychotic medications may also play a role in increasing the risk of diabetes.

----
[ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION AND DIABETES RISK]
The use of antipsychotic medications, particularly newer agents such as atypical or second-generation drugs, may increase the risk of developing diabetes. While the evidence is not conclusive, most antipsychotic drugs are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, with some agents, such as clozapine, potentially having a higher risk. The risk of diabetes associated with antipsychotic medications is likely due to their ability to induce weight gain and alter metabolic factors.
----
[DIABETES PREVENTION IN MENTAL HEALTH]
Engaging people with mental illness in lifestyle modification programs is crucial for long-term weight loss and diabetes prevention. Group sessions have been shown to be clinically useful and cost-effective in achieving this goal. A Cochrane review found that lifestyle interventions can lead to modest weight reduction and reduce antipsychotic-induced weight gain. 
----
[PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS FOR DIABETES PREVENTION]
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has established that metformin is associated with a 31% reduction in the incidence of diabetes. Metformin has also been shown to lead to modest reductions in weight in people receiving antipsychotics. This pharmacologic treatment can be considered for those unable to adapt their lifestyles to prevent diabetes.
----
[HEALTH PROMOTION IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE]
Primary care is likely the best source of health promotion for people with long-term mental health problems, but many patients depend on mental health teams for their health needs. There is a growing trend towards integrating physical health promotion into routine care pathways, including tailored advice on diet, exercise, and weight management. With appropriate education and support, people with severe mental illness (SMI) can modify their lifestyles and achieve significant weight loss.
----
[ANTIPSYCHOTICS AND DIABETES RISK]
Second-generation antipsychotics have been associated with an increased risk of diabetes, with some studies suggesting a higher risk compared to first-generation antipsychotics. The risk of diabetes varies among different antipsychotic medications, with some medications like clozapine and olanzapine having a higher risk than others like risperidone and quetiapine.
----
[DIABETES CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS]
Patients with psychotic disorders may have difficulty reporting symptoms or self-care to health professionals, requiring extra time and training for healthcare teams. Pharmacotherapy for psychotic disorders must consider the metabolic risks associated with antipsychotic drugs, and discontinuing these medications should be done with careful consideration and discussion with the psychiatric team. 
----
[PHARMACOTHERAPY AND METABOLIC RISKS]
Antipsychotic drugs can contribute to metabolic problems, and individual variation in response to these medications can make treatment choices challenging. Metformin may be a logical choice for preventing diabetes in patients taking antipsychotic medications, given its safety, tolerability, and modest cost, but further long-term trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness.
----
[EATING DISORDERS AND DIABETES]
Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS), can co-occur with diabetes and increase the risk of harm due to impaired self-care and glycemic control. These disorders are more common in adolescents and young adults, and their clinical significance may be increased when they co-occur with a chronic disease like diabetes.
----
[SCREENING FOR DIABETES IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS]
Patients with psychotic disorders should undergo routine screening for diabetes, at least annually, and more frequently if other risk factors are present. The best method of screening is still debated, but regular screening is necessary due to the significant risk of diabetes in this patient population.
----
[DIABETES AND EATING DISORDERS]
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are eating disorders that can affect individuals with diabetes, particularly those with type 1 diabetes. The onset of anorexia nervosa can be triggered by the diagnosis and treatment of type 1 diabetes, and individuals with anorexia often exhibit ritualized eating habits, cognitive rumination about eating, and irritability. The low weight associated with anorexia can lead to physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal complaints, lack of energy, and reduced libido. Individuals with anorexia may also experience social withdrawal and isolation, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.

----
[ANOREXIA NERVOSA SYMPTOMS]
Common physical symptoms of anorexia nervosa include gastrointestinal complaints, lack of energy, reduced libido, early waking, and postural dizziness. Individuals with anorexia may also experience amenorrhoea, infertility, and osteopenia, as well as bradycardia, hypotension, and peripheral neuropathy. Endocrine abnormalities, such as low sex hormone and tri-iodothyronine levels, and raised growth hormone and cortisol levels, may also be present. These symptoms can have a significant impact on the individual's overall health and well-being.

----
[BULIMIA NERVOSA CHARACTERISTICS]
Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating, accompanied by compensatory behaviors such as dietary restriction, vomiting, exercise, and misuse of laxatives or diuretics. Individuals with bulimia often have a past history of underweight and may have met the diagnostic criteria for anorexia in the past. The vicious cycle of dieting, bingeing, purging, and fear of weight gain can have a detrimental impact on other aspects of functioning, such as work and social relationships, and can have financial implications.

----
[PHYSICAL COMPLICATIONS OF BULIMIA]
Physical complications of bulimia include enlargement of the parotid glands, erosion of dental enamel, and hypokalemia resulting from vomiting, laxative, or diuretic misuse. These complications can have serious consequences for the individual's health and well-being, and highlight the importance of addressing the underlying eating disorder. Individuals with bulimia may also experience depression, self-harming behaviors, and other impulse control problems, which can further exacerbate the physical complications.

----
[PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EATING DISORDERS]
Individuals with eating disorders, including anorexia and bulimia, often have a characteristic set of attitudes and values concerning body shape and weight. They may complain of intense feelings of fatness, and extreme fear of loss of control over eating and consequent weight gain. This "core psychopathology" can lead to a distorted body image and a preoccupation with weight, shape, and food intake, which can have a significant impact on the individual's self-worth and overall well-being.
----
[DIABETES AND EATING DISORDERS]
Eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, can have a significant impact on diabetes outcome, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with eating disorders may use insulin omission or under-use as a means of weight control, leading to impaired glycemic control and increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. This behavior can also lead to acute dehydration and rapid weight loss.

----
[COMPLICATIONS OF EATING DISORDERS IN DIABETES]
Patients with diabetes and eating disorders are at risk of developing physical complications, such as ketoacidosis, due to impaired glycemic control. The under-use or omission of insulin can lead to rapid but often unsustainable weight loss, primarily through acute dehydration. This behavior is associated with a higher risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications if it persists.

----
[PREVALENCE OF EATING DISORDERS IN DIABETES]
Estimates of the prevalence of eating disorders in patients with diabetes are imprecise, but it is thought that a significant proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes may be at risk of developing an eating disorder. Eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) appear to be the most common presentation in routine clinical practice, and dieting is considered an important risk factor for the development of an eating disorder.

----
[DIABETES AS A RISK FACTOR FOR EATING DISORDERS]
Diabetes, particularly type 1 diabetes, may be a risk factor for the development of an eating disorder, especially in patients who are weight-conscious and use insulin omission or under-use as a means of weight control. The presence of diabetes can exacerbate the clinical features of an eating disorder, and patients with both conditions require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications.
----
[DIABETES AND EATING DISORDERS]
Eating disorders, such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa, can have a significant impact on diabetes management, requiring close liaison between the therapist managing the eating disorder and the team managing the diabetes. Treatment for eating disorders needs to be enhanced with attention to insulin or medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related dietary restrictions. Regular physical monitoring is necessary to manage the high risk of complications and mortality.

----
[ANOREXIA NERVOSA TREATMENT]
The treatment of anorexia nervosa in patients with diabetes involves restoring weight towards normal levels, while accepting that glycemic control may not be perfect. Severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia must be avoided, and the patient will need to monitor insulin dose and blood glucose levels as eating habits and weight change. The eating disorder therapist should have a good knowledge of the principles of treatment for diabetes.

----
[BULIMIA NERVOSA TREATMENT]
Treatment for bulimia, particularly through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), has been widely researched, and longitudinal studies have shown that eating disorder diagnoses are unstable over time. Cross-sectional studies may underestimate the proportion of the population that may be affected in the long run, and incidence rates in adolescent and young adult patients are higher than previously estimated.

----
[MANAGEMENT AND DETECTION]
Detection of eating disorders in patients with diabetes is crucial, as many may be secretive due to denial, guilt, or shame. Warning symptoms include marked weight fluctuation or loss, symptoms of hyperglycemia, frequent episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia, and growth retardation and pubertal delay in younger patients with type 1 diabetes. However, these features are not specific for eating disorders and are only indicative of poor self-care.
----
[DIABETES AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS]
Diabetes and psychiatric disorders can interact in complex ways, with psychiatric disorders having a significant impact on diabetes outcomes. Psychologic and behavioral factors are often the most important causes of poor metabolic control in patients with diabetes. Health professionals working with patients with diabetes require good knowledge and awareness of these issues to provide optimal care.

Clinical trials are aimed at preventing the initiation of islet autoimmunity, reducing autoimmune β-cell killing, or suppressing the immune response to halt β-cell killing and enhance β-cell regeneration. Several trials have been implemented or are ongoing, using dietary manipulation, parenteral or oral insulin, or immune-suppressing or immune-modulating agents to prevent or retard the progression of T1DM. Immune modulation with alum-formulated GAD65 has shown promise in reducing the loss of β-cells.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE 1 DIABETES]
The pathophysiologic mechanisms of T1DM involve autoimmunity triggered in genetically predisposed individuals, leading to β-cell killing by cellular immunity and insulin deficiency. The autoimmune insult can take months to years to develop, and several genetic, autoimmune, and biochemical markers can predict the disease prior to clinical onset. Once the clinical disease is established, patients will require strict control to sustain euglycemia and minimize complications.

----
[THE "HONEYMOON" PERIOD]
After clinical onset of diabetes and initiation of insulin treatment, the remaining β-cells often increase their capacity to produce insulin, decreasing the need for insulin treatment. This period of low insulin requirement, known as the "honeymoon" period, can last for months or even years and is advantageous for the patient, as it simplifies treatment and improves metabolic control, leading to less risk of long-term complications. The "honeymoon" period seems to be longer and more frequent in older children and adults than in children diagnosed at a younger age.
----

Non-antigen specific agents such as the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, ketotifen, and nicotinamide have been tested as possible preventive agents for type 1 diabetes. While some of these agents showed promise in animal studies, human pilot studies have yielded mixed results, highlighting the need for further research to identify effective preventive measures.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES PREDICTION]
Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) can be predicted by identifying environmental factors that trigger islet autoimmunity and by recognizing individuals at higher risk through genetic markers, such as HLA class II genes. The disease has a prolonged prodrome of islet autoimmunity, during which cellular and humoral immune markers may be present, and standardized assays have been developed to detect multiple islet autoantibodies. This predictive ability may help identify individuals at risk and initiate prevention or intervention at an appropriate point in time. 
----
[GENETIC MARKERS FOR T1DM]
Genetic markers, such as HLA class II genes, play a significant role in predicting T1DM, with almost 50% of T1DM risk among first-degree relatives (FDR) of Caucasian patients with T1DM attributed to HLA. High-risk class II DQ8 and DQ2 haplotypes are found in more than 90% of patients diagnosed before the age of 30. However, the diagnostic sensitivity of large-scale genetic screening is low, as only 10% of subjects with disease-associated HLA genes develop the disease.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS]
Early diagnosis of T1DM is crucial to prevent life-threatening conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is commonly seen in children under 4 years of age and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Predicting T1DM may provide a window of opportunity to initiate prevention programs to reduce or ideally prevent β-cell destruction, allowing for an early and symptom-free diagnosis of diabetes.
----
[TREATMENT AND COMPLICATIONS]
Currently, exogenous insulin injection is the only therapeutic measure that can correct hyperglycemia and enable patients with T1DM to live an almost normal life. However, complications are common and may develop within 10-12 years after onset, even with adequate metabolic control, highlighting the need for early intervention and prevention programs to reduce the risk of complications.
----
[DIABETES AUTOANTIBODIES]
The presence of multiple autoantibodies is often associated with a progressive process towards Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), with 60-100% of individuals with three or more autoantibodies developing clinical T1DM over 5-6 years. The number of detectable autoantibodies is related to the risk of T1DM, both in first-degree relatives (FDR) and the general population. Different autoantibodies, such as GAD65Ab, IA-2Ab, and IAA, may have different specificities for β-cell death.

----
[AUTOANTIBODY PATTERNS AND RISK]
The autoantibody pattern differs among age groups, with GAD65Ab suggested to be a marker of general non-specific autoimmunity, while IA-2Ab and IAA are more specific markers for β-cell death. Higher titers of autoantibodies may better predict the risk of persistent autoimmunity and T1DM, especially in combination with a high-risk HLA genotype. The level of autoantibodies can provide additional predictive information.

----
[BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS FOR T1DM]
Children progressing to T1DM often have several autoantibodies, high titers of ICA, IA-2Ab, and GAD65Ab, and decreased first-phase insulin response (FPIR) in response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). A combination of islet autoantibodies and FPIR may potentially predict diabetes, with reduced FPIR levels (< 50 mU/L) among autoantibody-positive subjects predicting T1DM among FDR by up to 92% over 10 years.

----
[INSULIN AUTOANTIBODIES AND β-CELL FUNCTION]
Insulin autoantibodies (IAA) are present in about 35-40% of children with T1DM at onset of the disease and may play a role in the autoimmune process of diabetes. C-peptide levels may diminish significantly 6 months prior to onset, predicting β-cell functional loss near diagnosis. Combining tests for IAA and C-peptide may detect metabolic disturbances and predict the disease prior to onset.
----
[PRIMARY PREVENTION TRIALS FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Primary prevention trials for Type 1 diabetes aim to prevent the initiation of autoimmune responses among infants with genetic susceptibility or a history of Type 1 diabetes among first-degree relatives. These trials often test the effects of safe, non-antigen-specific agents in relation to environmental risk determinants, such as nutritional factors. Results from observational studies have encouraged trials that use dietary manipulation to prevent Type 1 diabetes. Primary prevention trials tend to have longer follow-up durations, especially during the main window of autoimmunity triggering, which is from birth to 6 years.

----
[DIETARY MANIPULATION TO PREVENT TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Dietary manipulation has been explored as a potential way to prevent Type 1 diabetes, with studies investigating the effects of a gluten-free diet, cow's milk, and vitamin D supplementation. A gluten-free diet was found to have no significant preventive effect on the risk of Type 1 diabetes or on the titers of Type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies. However, hydrolyzed casein milk formula has shown promise in reducing the risk of Type 1 diabetes among genetically predisposed infants.

----
[VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION AND TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested to protect against Type 1 diabetes, possibly through its effects on T lymphocytes and suppression of cytokine production. Lower concentrations of vitamin D have been reported in children with Type 1 diabetes, and lower vitamin D levels during pregnancy have been linked to an increased risk of Type 1 diabetes in the child. Ongoing studies are investigating the potential of high-dose vitamin D supplementation to prevent Type 1 diabetes among genetically susceptible infants.

----
[NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTION STUDIES]
The Nutritional Intervention to Prevent Diabetes study found that supplementation with cod liver oil, a source of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, during the first year of life led to a reduced risk of Type 1 diabetes in Norwegian children. The study also found that children developing diabetes had a gradually deteriorating glucose tolerance with declining 2-hour C-peptide levels after an oral glucose tolerance test, despite stable fasting C-peptide levels. Additionally, body mass index (BMI) has been reported to provide additional information in Type 1 diabetes prediction.
----
[SECONDARY PREVENTION TRIALS]
Secondary prevention trials aim to reduce β-cell killing by autoimmunity and prevent progression to clinical diabetes. These trials can be divided into two groups: non-antigen-specific and antigen-specific trials.

Antigen-specific secondary prevention trials in T1DM have focused on the use of insulin and other antigens to prevent or delay the onset of the disease. Trials such as DPT-1 and DIPP have evaluated the effectiveness of parenteral and oral insulin, as well as intranasal insulin, in preventing or delaying the onset of T1DM in high-risk individuals. While some trials have shown no significant effect, subanalysis of the DPT-1 trial suggested that oral insulin may have a protective effect in individuals with high titers of insulin autoantibodies (IAA).

----
[ORAL INSULIN THERAPY]
Oral insulin therapy has been investigated as a potential means of preventing or delaying the onset of T1DM. The oral arm of the DPT-1 trial showed that oral insulin (7.5 mg/day) may have a protective effect in individuals with high titers of IAA (>80 U/mL), delaying the onset of diabetes by 4-5 years. This suggests that oral insulin may be a useful therapeutic strategy in individuals at high risk of developing T1DM, particularly those with high levels of IAA.
----
[NON-ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS]
Non-antigen-specific interventions for diabetes treatment involve the use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents.

----
[IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Immunotherapy for Type 1 diabetes aims to interrupt the autoimmune response and enhance β-cell regeneration to sustain normal glucose levels without exogenous insulin therapy. Combination therapies, such as IL-2 and sirolimus, are being tested in clinical trials to achieve this goal. These therapies aim to induce sustained β-cell protection and prevent disease progression. The synergetic effects of these drugs are thought to be through enhancing the shifting of Th1 lymphocytes into protective Th2 regulatory lymphocytes.

----
[ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS]
Several ongoing clinical trials are testing the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressive agents, such as mycophenolate mofetil and daclizumab, in preserving β-cell function and enhancing regeneration in subjects with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes. These trials will assess the potential of these agents to reduce the loss of C-peptides after diagnosis. The results of these trials will inform future directions for drug therapy in Type 1 diabetes.

----
[FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES TREATMENT]
Future drug therapy for Type 1 diabetes will depend on the success of ongoing and planned intervention trials. Immunomodulation, alone or combined with immunosuppressive therapy, seems promising in reducing the loss of C-peptides after diagnosis. The route of administration, such as oral insulin or oral GAD65, needs further exploration, and safe immune tolerance trials may provide a novel approach to understanding the human immune system's response to immune therapy with autoantigens.

----
[DIAMYD THERAPY]
Diamyd, a therapy that aims to prevent further β-cell destruction, has shown promising results in a subgroup of children diagnosed with diabetes within 6 months.

----
[GENETIC FACTORS IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Research has identified several genetic factors that contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, including non-HLA genes that influence the development of persistent islet autoimmunity. Studies have shown that certain genotypes, such as the insulin VNTR I/III genotype, are associated with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. Additionally, genetic risk determines the emergence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies in young children.

----
[AUTOANTIGENS IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Autoantigens, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and IA-2, play a crucial role in the development of type 1 diabetes. These autoantigens are recognized by the immune system, leading to an autoimmune response that destroys the pancreatic beta cells. Other autoantigens, such as ZnT8, have also been identified as major autoantigens in human type 1 diabetes.

----
[EARLY SIGNS OF BETA-CELL AUTOIMMUNITY]
The first signs of beta-cell autoimmunity appear in infancy in genetically susceptible children from the general population. Studies, such as the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Study, have shown that the emergence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies is affected by genetic risk and can be detected at birth or in early childhood.

----
[IMMUNE RESPONSE IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
The immune response in type 1 diabetes involves the production of autoantibodies against various islet cell proteins, including GAD and IA-2. This autoimmune response leads to the destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, resulting in insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Understanding the immune response in type 1 diabetes is crucial for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.
----
[DIABETES PREVENTION TRIALS]
The Diabetes Prevention Trial - Type 1 has shown positive results in preventing the onset of type 1 diabetes. Studies have also explored the use of prophylactic insulin therapy to reduce the incidence of diabetes in high-risk individuals. Additionally, research has investigated the role of dietary factors, such as gluten and cow's milk, in the development of type 1 diabetes.

----
[DIETARY FACTORS AND TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Dietary factors, such as the elimination of gluten and cow's milk, have been studied for their potential to reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes. However, research has shown that eliminating gluten does not reduce the risk of developing type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies. Furthermore, studies have investigated the effect of cow's milk exposure on the development of type 1 diabetes, with some suggesting a potential link.

----
[VITAMIN D AND TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Vitamin D has been studied for its potential role in preventing type 1 diabetes. Research has shown that vitamin D supplementation in early childhood may reduce the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Additionally, studies have found that higher intake of vitamin D is associated with a lower risk of type 1 diabetes.

----
[OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS AND TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Omega-3 fatty acids have been investigated for their potential to reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes. Research has shown that higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a lower risk of islet autoimmunity, a precursor to type 1 diabetes.

----
[ISLET AUTOIMMUNITY AND TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Islet autoimmunity is a key factor in the development of type 1 diabetes. Research has shown that anti-islet autoantibodies usually develop sequentially rather than simultaneously, and that the natural course of preclinical type 1 diabetes involves the progression of islet autoimmunity to overt diabetes.
----
[RESEARCH ON TYPE 1 DIABETES TREATMENTS]
Researchers have been exploring various treatments for Type 1 diabetes, including the use of the BCG vaccine, diazoxide, and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies.

Immunotherapy has been explored as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes, with studies investigating the use of recombinant vaccinia virus expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and altered-peptide ligands such as NBI-6024. These therapies aim to modulate the immune response and prevent or delay the onset of autoimmune diabetes. Research has shown promising results in animal models, with some studies demonstrating the ability to induce protective insulitis and prevent disease progression.
----
[GLUTAMIC ACID DECARBOXYLASE (GAD) TREATMENT]
GAD treatment has been studied as a potential therapy for recent-onset type 1 diabetes, with clinical trials demonstrating its safety and efficacy in preserving insulin secretion. Studies have also investigated the use of GAD immunomodulation in adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, with evidence suggesting its safety and potential benefits. Additionally, research has shown that neonatal tolerization with GAD can delay the onset of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice.
----
[COMBINATION THERAPY FOR AUTOIMMUNE DIABETES]
Combination therapy using anti-CD3 and nasal proinsulin has been shown to enhance remission from recent-onset autoimmune diabetes by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs). Other studies have investigated the use of combination therapy with sirolimus and interleukin-2, which has been found to prevent spontaneous and recurrent autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. These findings suggest that combination therapy may be a promising approach for the treatment of autoimmune diabetes.
----
[IMMUNOMODULATION AND ISLET GRAFT SURVIVAL]
Immunomodulation using GAD has been found to inhibit disease progression and prolong islet graft survival in diabetes-prone mice. Studies have also demonstrated that induction of GAD65-specific regulatory T cells can inhibit ongoing autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice. These findings highlight the potential benefits of immunomodulation in preventing or treating autoimmune diabetes.
----
[INTRODUCTION TO FUTURE DIABETES TREATMENTS]
The development of new treatments for type 2 diabetes is crucial due to the limitations of current therapies in achieving normal glucose homeostasis and preventing long-term complications. New therapeutic approaches are being explored to address the metabolic disturbances of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These approaches include new and improved agents that can be used alone or in combination with existing therapies to provide better glycemic control and reduce the risk of complications.

----
[NEW ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS IN DEVELOPMENT]
New antidiabetic agents are being developed, including longer-acting analogs of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and new dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. Other potential treatments include non-peptide molecules that act as GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin mimetics, as well as potentiators of insulin action, such as specific phosphatase inhibitors.

----
[IDEAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NEW ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
A new antidiabetic drug should be safe, well-tolerated, and conveniently administered, with minimal risk of serious hypoglycemia. It should offer durable efficacy and preferably other advantages, such as a novel mode of action or favorable pharmacokinetics. Ideally, a new agent will be suited to combination therapy with existing agents and confer benefits against conditions commonly associated with diabetes, such as abdominal obesity and hypertension.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Early, effective, and sustained glycemic control is crucial in managing type 2 diabetes, as it can defer the onset and reduce the severity of complications. The concept of "glycemic memory" emphasizes the importance of good glycemic control early after diagnosis to minimize the complications of hyperglycemia later in the disease process. Comprehensive risk factor management, including lifestyle measures and pharmacologic interventions, is essential in achieving optimal glycemic control.
----
[GLUCOSE-LOWERING DRUGS]
Glucose-lowering drugs used to treat diabetes include inhibitors of carbohydrate digestion and intestinal glucose absorption, anti-obesity agents, and insulin-sensitizing agents. These drugs can help reduce post-prandial hyperglycemia and may have some benefit in reducing basal glycemia. Examples of glucose-lowering drugs are listed in Table 60.2, and other compounds under investigation are listed in Table 60.3.

----
[INHIBITORS OF INTESTINAL CARBOHYDRATE DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION]
Inhibitors of intestinal carbohydrate digestion and absorption can reduce post-prandial hyperglycemia and may have some benefit in reducing basal glycemia. This approach is usually suitable for combination with most other antidiabetic therapies, although efficacy can be variable and generally modest.

----
[CLASSIFICATION OF NEW ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS]
Blood glucose-lowering agents can be classified as either hypoglycemic or antihyperglycemic. Hypoglycemic agents can lower blood glucose concentrations below the euglycemic range, carrying the risk of clinical hypoglycemia, while antihyperglycemic agents do not lower blood glucose below the euglycemic range when used as monotherapy.

----
[DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DRUGS]
The development of new drugs involves several stages, including preclinical stages, clinical stages, and post-marketing surveillance. The preclinical stages involve identification, extraction, and synthesis of compounds, as well as genotoxicity testing and pharmacology studies. Clinical stages involve trials in healthy human volunteers and patients, with a focus on efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics.
----
[DIABETES TREATMENT OPTIONS]
The treatment of type 2 diabetes involves various medications that target different aspects of glucose metabolism, including GLP-1 analogs, DPP-4 inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. These medications can help lower blood glucose levels by enhancing insulin secretion, reducing glucose absorption, or increasing glucose elimination. Additionally, dietary fiber supplements can also play a role in reducing post-prandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.

----
[MECHANISMS OF ACTION]
The mechanisms of action of these medications vary, with some inhibiting carbohydrate digestion, stimulating insulin secretion, or enhancing nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. For example, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors inhibit carbohydrate digestion, while GLP-1 analogs and DPP-4 inhibitors enhance nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. Understanding the mechanisms of action of these medications can help healthcare providers choose the most effective treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes.

----
[DIETARY FIBER SUPPLEMENTS]
Dietary fiber supplements, including soluble and insoluble fibers, can help reduce post-prandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Soluble fibers, such as gums, pectins, and hemicelluloses, appear to be more effective than insoluble fibers, such as celluloses and wheat bran, in reducing blood glucose levels. These fibers can act as a barrier to diffusion within the small intestine, impeding access of digestive enzymes and restricting the diffusion of liberated saccharides.

----
[NEW AND INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS]
New and investigational agents, such as insulin secretagogues, insulin mimetics, and direct glucose regulators, are being developed to treat type 2 diabetes. These agents can stimulate insulin secretion, enhance insulin action, or increase glucose metabolism, and may offer new treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes. Examples of these agents include voglibose, mitiglinide, and GLP-1 analogs.
----
[DIETARY FIBER SUPPLEMENTS]
Dietary fiber supplements, such as soluble guar gum, have been shown to have a small prandial blood glucose-lowering effect, especially in individuals consuming a balanced diet with fruit and vegetables. These supplements can slow the rate of carbohydrate digestion. Guar gum is a galactomannan polysaccharide from the Indian cluster bean, and its structure is composed of alpha-galactose and mannose units.
----
[CARBOHYDRATE DIGESTION INHIBITORS]
Inhibitors of carbohydrate digestion, such as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose, miglitol), can reduce post-prandial hyperglycemia by slowing the digestion of complex carbohydrates. These inhibitors act by competitive, reversible inhibition of intestinal brush-border alpha-glucosidase enzymes. However, they may cause side effects such as flatulence and diarrhea if not properly titrated.
----
[INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES]
Insulin secretagogues are agents that stimulate insulin secretion and can be categorized into initiators (e.g., sulfonylureas) and potentiators (e.g., GLP-1 analogs). An ideal insulin secretagogue would restore beta-cell sensitivity to glucose and support adequate biosynthesis, processing, and secretion of insulin in response to various stimuli. These agents can help address defects in islet beta-cell function that occur in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
----
[ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS]
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, miglitol, and voglibose, are used to treat type 2 diabetes. These agents have different affinities for specific alpha-glucosidases, with acarbose having a higher affinity for glucoamylase and miglitol and voglibose potently inhibiting sucrase. Voglibose shows more potent inhibition of other alpha-glucosidases than acarbose. Acarbose also weakly inhibits alpha-amylase.

----
[KATP CHANNEL STRUCTURE]
The ATP-sensitive (KATP) channel in the beta-cell membrane consists of a large sulfonylurea subunit (SUR1) and a smaller pore-forming unit (Kir6.2) that acts as an inwardly rectifying K channel. The SUR1 subunit has separate binding sites for sulfonylureas, benzamido compounds, and nucleotides. Four complete channel units self-associate to form an octameric complex in the membrane.

----
[INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES]
Sulfonylureas and meglitinides are oral insulin secretagogues that initiate insulin secretion by binding to the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) in the plasma membrane of the beta-cell. They bind to either the sulfonylurea site or the benzamide site on the SUR1, which is part of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel). This binding leads to the initiation of insulin secretion.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION MECHANISM]
Insulin secretion is initiated by the closure of K ATP channels, which leads to localized depolarization of the plasma membrane, opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, and an increase in cytosolic calcium ion concentration. This activates calcium-sensitive proteins, triggering the exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules. The closure of K ATP channels is a key step in insulin secretion, but it does not promote insulin biosynthesis.

----
[NOVEL INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES]
Several novel insulin secretagogues have been reported to act by closing the K ATP channels, including the meglitinide derivative mitiglinide (KAD-1229) and imidazoline compounds. These agents bind to specific sites on the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) or interact with other receptors to enhance insulin secretion. Some of these compounds, such as succinate esters, also fuel glucose metabolism and increase proinsulin biosynthesis.

----
[INSULIN SECRETION PATHWAY]
The insulin secretion pathway involves the binding of ATP to the nucleotide-binding domains of the K ATP channel, which closes the Kir6.2 pore and prevents K+ efflux. This leads to localized depolarization of the plasma membrane, opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, and an increase in cytosolic calcium ion concentration. The resulting activation of calcium-sensitive proteins triggers the exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules.

----
[INSULIN BIOSYNTHESIS]
Agents that increase nutrient metabolism and close K ATP channels through increased ATP production can also enhance proinsulin biosynthesis. This is illustrated by esters of succinic acid, which provide a metabolizable substrate to the mitochondria and increase proinsulin biosynthesis. However, these compounds have low enteral bioavailability and a short duration of action, and they also fuel gluconeogenesis in the liver.
----
[GLUCOKINASE ACTIVATORS]
Glucokinase (GK) activators stimulate hepatic glucose utilization and reduce hepatic glucose production, adding to their blood glucose-lowering potency. These agents can operate at low glucose concentrations and have been shown to increase insulin secretion and improve glucose homeostasis in models of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Several small molecule activators of GK are in clinical trial, with potential benefits for islet function and glucose regulation.

----
[INCRETIN HORMONES]
Incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), enhance insulin secretion by activating specific G-protein coupled receptors in the β-cell membrane. These hormones potentiate nutrient-induced insulin secretion and insulin biosynthesis, and are released from the gut during feeding. They play a key role in regulating blood glucose levels, particularly after meals.

----
[INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES]
Insulin secretagogues, such as glibenclamide and meglitinide derivatives, stimulate insulin secretion and can be used to treat Type 2 diabetes. These agents work by binding to specific receptors on the β-cell membrane, triggering an increase in insulin release. Novel insulin secretagogues, such as morpholinoguanidine and imidazoline compounds, are also being developed as potential treatments for diabetes.

----
[POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS]
Potential opportunities to increase nutrient-induced insulin secretion include targeting the glucokinase pathway, incretin hormones, and insulin secretagogues. These approaches aim to enhance insulin secretion, improve glucose homeostasis, and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Further research is needed to fully explore the therapeutic potential of these targets and to develop effective treatments for Type 2 diabetes.
----
[INSULIN SECRETION MECHANISMS]
Insulin secretion is a complex process involving various cellular mechanisms, including the opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and the mobilization of Ca2+ stores. The process is also influenced by ATP-sensitive K+ channels and calcium-dependent proteins. Additionally, microtubules and microfilaments play a role in insulin secretion. 

----
[TARGETS FOR ENHANCING INSULIN SECRETION]
Several sites on the pancreatic β-cell offer potential targets to potentiate nutrient-induced insulin secretion, including the activation of β2-adrenoceptors, GIP, and GLP-1 receptors. Antagonists of the inhibitory α2-adrenoceptors also stimulate insulin secretion. Other potential targets include GK activators, cholinergic agents, and CCK.

----
[INCRETIN HORMONES AND β-CELL MASS]
Incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP have been shown to increase β-cell mass in animal models by promoting β-cell proliferation and differentiation, slowing β-cell apoptosis, and increasing β-cell neogenesis from ductal progenitor cells. These effects are mediated, at least partly, through increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and production of protein kinase A (PKA).

----
[TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR DIABETES]
GLP-1 has been favored as a treatment option for diabetes due to its ability to promote β-cell mass and enhance insulin secretion. Other treatment options, such as exenatide, PDE inhibitors, and β2-adrenoceptor antagonists, may also be effective in enhancing insulin secretion and improving glucose metabolism.
----
[GLP-1 THERAPY FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES]
GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is a potential therapy for Type 2 diabetes as it suppresses glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, and exerts a satiety effect that can facilitate weight loss. GLP-1 concentrations are reduced in Type 2 diabetes, but its ability to enhance insulin release is maintained. When injected subcutaneously before a meal, GLP-1 can substantially reduce the post-prandial rise in blood glucose concentrations in Type 2 diabetes.
----
[GLP-1 DEGRADATION AND ANALOGS]
The rapid degradation of GLP-1 by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and its short plasma half-life make it an inconvenient form of therapy. However, GLP-1 analogs such as exenatide and liraglutide are resistant to degradation by DPP-4, extending their half-life and making them more suitable for therapeutic use. These analogs have a modified amino acid structure that prevents DPP-4 from cleaving off an N-terminal dipeptide.
----
[MECHANISM OF GLP-1 ANALOGS]
Exenatide and liraglutide are GLP-1 analogs that mimic the action of native GLP-1, enhancing insulin release, suppressing glucagon secretion, and slowing gastric emptying. They also have a satiety effect, which can facilitate weight loss. The amino acid structure of these analogs is modified to prevent degradation by DPP-4, allowing them to have a longer duration of action and making them more effective in reducing blood glucose levels in Type 2 diabetes.
----
[COMPARISON OF GLP-1 AND GIP]
GLP-1 and GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide) are incretin hormones that enhance insulin secretion in response to glucose. However, GLP-1 has additional effects, including suppressing glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and reducing appetite, making it a more promising therapy for Type 2 diabetes. The plasma concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced in Type 2 diabetes, while GIP concentrations are normal or slightly reduced.
----
[GLP-1 AGONISTS]
GLP-1 agonists, such as liraglutide and exenatide, are incretin therapies that mimic the action of the natural hormone GLP-1, promoting glucose-dependent insulin release and suppressing glucagon secretion. These medications have been shown to have a limited risk of hypoglycemia and can assist with weight loss, making them a favorable option for obese patients. Liraglutide, in particular, has a once-daily injection formulation, while exenatide has a once-weekly depot formulation.

----
[GLP-1 AGONIST DEVELOPMENT]
Several other GLP-1 agonists are in clinical development, including albiglutide, taspoglutide, and lixisenatide, with varying formulations and administration routes, such as once-weekly injections or inhaled forms. These new developments aim to improve the efficacy and convenience of GLP-1 agonist therapy for diabetes management. Hybrid peptides and non-peptide GLP-1 receptor agonists are also being explored to enhance glucose-lowering efficacy.

----
[GIP AND GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS]
GIP, another incretin hormone, potentiates nutrient-induced insulin secretion but also increases glucagon release and promotes lipid deposition. Research has shown that GIP receptor antagonism, either through pharmacologic means or "metabolic surgery," may provide a new antidiabetic mechanism by preventing the development of obesity and improving glucose homeostasis. This is consistent with evidence from bariatric surgery, which has been shown to rapidly improve glycemic control in obese patients with diabetes.

----
[DPP-4 INHIBITORS]
DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of medications that prevent the rapid inactivation of endogenous incretins, such as GLP-1 and GIP, thereby raising their circulating concentrations and increasing nutrient-stimulated insulin release. By inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, these medications can improve glucose homeostasis and have been shown to be effective in the management of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES TREATMENT OPTIONS]
The development of new treatments for Type 2 diabetes is ongoing, with a focus on targeting specific enzymes and receptors to improve insulin secretion and sensitivity. DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin, are a class of drugs that have shown promise in treating Type 2 diabetes. These drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, which breaks down incretin hormones that stimulate insulin secretion. 
----
[INSULIN RESISTANCE]
Insulin resistance is a key feature of Type 2 diabetes, characterized by impaired insulin action and heterogeneous defects in insulin receptor function and post-receptor signaling pathways. Insulin resistance is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, and defects in insulin receptor structure are uncommon. Therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing insulin resistance may need to target diverse intracellular targets to be effective.
----
[EMERGING THERAPIES]
Several new compounds are in development for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, including PSN9301, GR-8200, PHX-1149, SSR-162369, ALS 2-0426, and NN-7201. These compounds are being investigated for their potential to improve insulin secretion and sensitivity, and may offer new treatment options for patients with Type 2 diabetes. 
----
[DPP-4 INHIBITORS]
A list of DPP-4 inhibitors, including sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin, is provided, along with their clinical phase, specificity data, and company information. These drugs have been marketed or are in development for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, and have shown varying levels of efficacy and specificity in inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme.
----
[INSULIN MIMETICS]
Insulin mimetics, such as L-783,281, have been shown to mimic the effects of insulin through activation of the insulin receptor. This compound has been found to initiate phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity of the β-subunit of the human insulin receptor, leading to increased glucose uptake by isolated rodent adipocytes and skeletal muscle. L-783,281 has also been shown to lower blood glucose in insulin-resistant obese-diabetic mice.

----
[INSULIN SIGNALING PATHWAYS]
The intracellular insulin signaling pathway involves several key molecules, including insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt). This pathway regulates glucose uptake and metabolism, as well as other cellular processes such as protein synthesis and gene transcription. Understanding these pathways is important for the development of therapeutic interventions for diabetes.

----
[INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR I]
Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can weakly mimic the effects of insulin through low affinity binding to the insulin receptor. However, its role in glucose regulation is not as well understood as that of insulin, and it is not currently a target for therapeutic intervention in diabetes.

----
[POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS]
Several potential therapeutic targets have been identified in the insulin signaling pathway, including protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibitors of these molecules may have potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes.
----
[INSULIN RECEPTOR POTENTIATION]
Insulin receptor signaling can be enhanced and/or prolonged by several different mechanisms, including the use of non-peptide molecules such as TLK16998. This molecule increases insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit and potentiates β-subunit phosphorylation initiated by insulin. TLK16998 has been shown to lower glucose concentrations in insulin-resistant obese-diabetic mice. Its structure is depicted in Figure 60.14, along with another compound, L-783,281, that improves insulin action by direct interaction with insulin receptors.

----
[INSULIN SIGNALING CASCADES]
The insulin signaling cascades can be ameliorated by targeting early post-receptor components, which can help improve insulin action in cases of severe insulin resistance caused by genetic defects of the insulin receptor. Additionally, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can assist glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but its use is limited due to potential proliferative effects and other unwanted side effects.

----
[C-PEPTIDE AND INSULIN ACTION]
C-peptide, which is secreted from pancreatic β-cells along with insulin, appears to bind to G-protein coupled receptors in several insulin-sensitive tissues and can increase glycogen synthesis during submaximal stimulation with insulin. Physiologic concentrations of C-peptide have been shown to increase insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation of IRS1, suggesting that C-peptide may be useful in improving insulin action in C-peptide deficient states.

----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION OVERVIEW]
Islet transplantation is a promising treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes, particularly those with severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, and/or glycemic lability. Successful islet transplantation can lead to insulin independence, although this is usually not maintained in the long term. Graft function is preserved for several years beyond the loss of insulin independence, resulting in better glycemic control despite a return to insulin use.

----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION OUTCOMES]
Current immunosuppression protocols, including the use of more potent induction agents, may lead to better long-term outcomes for islet transplantation. The side effects of maintenance immunosuppression are better understood, and appropriate dose titration and/or change to alternative agents have led to fewer and more tolerable side effects. The long-term impact of islet transplantation on diabetes-related complications is not fully elucidated, but there appears to be stabilization of microvascular and macrovascular disease.

----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION BENEFITS]
Islet transplantation can provide several benefits for patients with type 1 diabetes, including improved glycemic control, reduced hypoglycemia, and enhanced quality of life. While insulin independence may not be sustained, the preservation of graft function can still offer significant advantages over traditional insulin therapy. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of islet transplantation and to optimize treatment protocols.

----
[ISLET CELL REGENERATION]
Research has shown that adult pancreatic beta cells can be formed through self-duplication rather than stem cell differentiation. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that new insulin-producing cells can be generated from endogenous progenitors in injured adult mouse pancreas. These findings have important implications for the development of new treatments for diabetes, including islet transplantation and regenerative therapies.
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION RESEARCH]
Islet allotransplantation has been successfully performed in animals, and human islets have been isolated to function in diabetic nude mice. The results of these studies highlighted the need for purified islets and the importance of the site of transplantation. Multicellular islet tissue comprises a small percentage of the whole pancreas, and careful digestion is necessary to achieve a purified preparation.

----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION SITES]
The site of transplantation is a crucial factor, with the liver, spleen, renal subcapsule, and omental pouch being the primary locations tried. A site with portal drainage has the natural advantage of mimicking the normal route of insulin delivery and is most commonly used for human islet transplantation. However, all sites have disadvantages, including lower oxygenation and elevated intra-islet blood pressure.

----
[EARLY HUMAN ISLET TRANSPLANT STUDIES]
The first human islet transplants were performed in the 1970s, with insulin independence rarely reported. Up to 1998, approximately 260 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) had received an islet transplant, with only 12% remaining insulin independent for more than 1 week. Early studies demonstrated the challenges of achieving insulin independence and the need for improved immunosuppression therapy and transplantation techniques.

----
[CHALLENGES IN ACHIEVING NORMOGLYCEMIA]
Despite advances in therapy, achieving normoglycemia remains a challenge. Intensive insulin therapy, continuous subcutaneous insulin administration, and carbohydrate counting can help improve glucose control, but the risk of hypoglycemia remains a limiting factor. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reported a threefold increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, highlighting the need for careful management and monitoring.
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION SUCCESS FACTORS]
The success of islet transplantation is dependent on several factors, including the purity of islet preparations, adequate islet numbers, and effective immunosuppression. The Edmonton protocol, which uses a steroid-free immunosuppression regimen, has achieved insulin independence in consecutive cases. An adequate islet mass, with over 11,000 islet equivalents per kilogram recipient body weight, is crucial for success. 
----
[ISLET ISOLATION TECHNIQUES]
The isolation of islets from the pancreas has been improved through various techniques, including the use of the University of Wisconsin perfusate solution, intraductal delivery of collagenase, and the development of a metal chamber for mechanical digestion. The enzyme preparation Liberase has also been widely used for islet isolation, resulting in better preparations with low endotoxin load. 
----
[ISLET PURIFICATION AND CULTURE]
Purification of islets using a refrigerated COBE centrifuge and Ficoll gradient is important to reduce the risk of intraportal hypertension, but may also remove ductal elements that could be important for islet neogenesis. Short-term culture of islets may lead to enhanced purity without excessive loss of islets, and newer methods have removed xenoproteins from the process, potentially reducing the risk of rejection. 
----
[IMMUNOSUPPRESSION REGIMENS]
The appropriate immunosuppression regimen is crucial for the success of islet transplantation, with the Edmonton protocol using daclizumab for induction and maintenance. The regimen has allowed patients to achieve insulin independence, although the required islet mass is higher in the allotransplant environment than in autotransplantation.
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION PROCESS]
Islet transplantation involves culturing islets for up to 72 hours prior to transplantation, allowing for administration of conditioning or immunosuppressive therapies and improved safety. This process also enables better islet characterization before transplant and reduces the risk of portal vein thrombosis. The use of regional islet processing centers has been advocated to standardize the islet product and improve transplant outcomes.

----
[ENZYME PREPARATION AND DIGESTION PROTOCOLS]
The enzyme preparation Liberase was found to have a potential risk of prion transmission due to contamination with bovine brain infusion extract. As a result, most islet isolation centers have switched to an alternative enzyme manufactured by Serva, which has a lower risk of prion transmission. The Serva collagenase is less pure and less potent than Liberase, but modification of digestion protocols has achieved a high rate of islet isolation success.

----
[TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE]
The transplant procedure involves percutaneous access under sedation, followed by infiltration of local anesthetic and advancement of a 22-gauge Cheba needle under fluoroscopic guidance. Immunosuppression therapy with sirolimus and low-dose tacrolimus is used to prevent rejection, allowing for the omission of steroids from the regimen and reducing β-cell toxicity.

----
[IMMUNOSUPPRESSION THERAPY]
Immunosuppression therapy with sirolimus and low-dose tacrolimus is used to prevent rejection in islet transplant patients. Sirolimus inhibits T-cell expression and activation, while daclizumab, an antibody to IL-2 receptors, provides potent immunosuppression. However, sirolimus can result in lipid abnormalities, which must be monitored and managed.
----
[IMMUNOSUPPRESSION REGIMENS]
The immunosuppressive regimen for islet transplantation has undergone modifications, with the original Edmonton protocol still being used today with some changes. Daclizumab was initially given at a dosage of 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks, but this was later changed to 2 mg/kg at transplant and at 5 days post-transplant. Recently, induction with antithymocyte globulin and etanercept, with maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, has been used. 
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION OUTCOMES]
Islet transplantation outcomes have shown that insulin independence was achieved in 11 out of the first 12 patients, with improved HbA1c levels and glucose control stability. However, insulin independence was not sustainable in the long term for the majority of patients, with only approximately 10% of patients remaining off insulin at 5 years. Most patients still had C-peptide present, indicating some level of graft function.
----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Patients who remained off insulin after islet transplantation had the best blood glucose control, with a median HbA1c of 6.2%. Patients who were back on insulin but still had C-peptide had a median HbA1c of 6.7%, while those who had lost all graft function had relatively poor glucose control, with a median HbA1c of 9.0% and required more insulin than before the transplant.
----
[TRANSPLANTATION PROCEDURE]
The transplantation procedure involves infusing purified islets into the portal vein, with monitoring of portal pressure to prevent complications. The procedure can be done using a percutaneous approach, with a guidewire and catheter inserted into the main portal vein, or through other methods such as computer tomography guidance or laparoscopy.
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION OUTCOMES]
Islet transplantation can lead to insulin independence, as indicated by the presence of C-peptide, with current survival analysis showing a positive correlation between graft function and insulin independence. The survival rate for insulin-independent patients is higher compared to those who are insulin-dependent. Glycemic control is also related to islet graft function, with better control resulting in improved outcomes. 

----
[HYPOGLYCEMIA ASSESSMENT SCORES]
The HYPO score and lability index (LI) are used to measure the severity of hypoglycemia and glycemic lability, with higher scores indicating more severe episodes. These scores are calculated using self-glucose monitoring results and self-reported hypoglycemic episodes, and are used to assess suitability for transplant and follow-up after transplant. The Clarke score is also used to indicate hypoglycemia unawareness, with a score of four or more indicating unawareness. 

----
[INDICATIONS FOR ISLET TRANSPLANTATION]
A key indication for islet transplantation is hypoglycemia unawareness, as patients with this condition can benefit from improved glucose control and reduced risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes. Islet transplantation can also lead to improved counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia, although the extent of this improvement can vary between patients. 

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS AFTER ISLET TRANSPLANTATION]
Retinopathy has been reported to remain stable following islet transplantation, with the majority of patients experiencing no significant change in their retinopathy status. This suggests that islet transplantation may help to prevent or slow the progression of diabetes-related complications, such as retinopathy.
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION COMPLICATIONS]
Islet transplantation can result in complications such as portal vein thrombosis, gallbladder puncture, and arteriovenous fistulae formation, although these are rare. Liver enzymes may be elevated in over 50% of transplants, but these changes are generally subclinical and resolve spontaneously within a month. Changes consistent with fatty liver have also been observed post-transplantation, which may be related to high insulin levels.
----
[IMMUNOSUPPRESSION SIDE EFFECTS]
Most patients experience some side effects from immunosuppression, including mouth ulcers, gastrointestinal disturbances, acne, and peripheral edema. Ovarian cysts are also common in women after islet transplantation, but sirolimus withdrawal or the use of combined oral contraception may reduce cyst size and development. Other complications related to immunosuppressive therapy include anemia, leukopenia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
----
[RENAL FUNCTION AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSION]
Tacrolimus has been associated with nephrotoxicity and tremor in a dose-dependent manner, while the combination of sirolimus and tacrolimus may worsen renal function. Switching to mycophenolate mofetil may stabilize or improve renal impairment in some patients. Mycophenolate mofetil is generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most common.
----
[OPHTHALMOLOGIC FOLLOW-UP]
Close ophthalmologic follow-up is necessary after islet transplantation, as some patients may experience vitreous hemorrhage or require laser photocoagulation. However, most patients show either no change or an improvement in retinopathy grade compared to baseline 3 years following transplantation.
----
[NEPHROPATHY PROGRESSION]
The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may decline over time after islet transplantation, with a median rate of decline comparable to that seen in optimally treated albuminuric patients with type 1 diabetes. However, for some patients, the decline in eGFR may exceed that seen in untreated diabetic nephropathy, highlighting the need for close monitoring.
----
[IMMUNOSUPPRESSION STRATEGY]
The current approach to immunosuppression in islet transplantation is to wean down to single agent therapy with mycophenolate (Myfortic® therapy) when a patient loses all islet function, rather than withdrawing all immunosuppression. This strategy aims to reduce the risk of subsequent sensitization. The effectiveness of this approach is still being evaluated. 
----
[COMMON COMPLICATIONS]
Common complications following clinical islet transplantation include gastrointestinal symptoms, pneumonia, and cytomegaloviral disease. However, with experience, the immunosuppression regimen can be tailored to minimize side effects without compromising graft function, resulting in fewer complications in more recently transplanted patients.
----
[IMMUNE SENSITIZATION]
Immune sensitization, as measured by panel reactive antibodies (PRA), can impact islet transplant outcome negatively. A pre-transplant PRA of >15% in either class I or II is an independent predictor of poor graft survival. For individuals with high PRA, it is essential to determine the specific antibodies causing the positive PRA and perform a flow cytometry-based cross-match against potential donors.
----
[REASONS FOR IMMUNOSUPPRESSION CHANGE]
The most frequent reasons for changing immunosuppression regimens after islet transplantation are peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, and ovarian cysts in women. These complications often improve after the immunosuppression change, with no significant changes in graft function or immune status.
----
[COMPLICATION RATES]
The rates of complications following clinical islet transplantation have decreased over time, with significant differences observed between the first 50 and next 49 patients in the Edmonton study. The most common complications include gastrointestinal symptoms, edema, headache, and pneumonia.
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION INDICATIONS]
Islet transplantation is offered to patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) who have severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness, or glycemic lability, despite optimal medical therapy. The decision to undergo islet transplantation is based on clinical judgment, with the use of the HYPO score and LI adding an objective component. Patients with progressive complications despite optimization of medical therapy are considered on a case-by-case basis.
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Diabetes-related complications are not absolute contraindications for islet transplantation, but certain conditions require careful consideration. For example, patients with unstable retinopathy are recommended to wait 6 months from the last treatment before islet transplantation, and those with macroalbuminuria or a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction may be contraindicated. A full evaluation, including a thorough history and physical examination, is required to determine suitability for islet transplantation.
----
[PATIENT EVALUATION FOR ISLET TRANSPLANTATION]
Patients undergoing evaluation for islet transplantation should have a realistic expectation of the outcome and be willing to accept the risks of the procedure and immunosuppression. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, with a focus on diabetes complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and vascular disease. Laboratory tests, including an ophthalmology report, 24-hour urine test, and creatinine clearance, are also required to assess the patient's suitability for islet transplantation.
----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION CRITERIA]
The indications for islet transplantation include a clinical history compatible with Type 1 diabetes, intensive diabetes management, and at least one severe hypoglycemic event in the past year. Patients must also have a stimulated C-peptide level < 0.3 μg/L on a mixed meal tolerance test and undergo frequent glucose testing and insulin injections or pump therapy as directed by a healthcare specialist.
----
[MONITORING ISLET GRAFT FUNCTION]
Methods for monitoring graft function in islet transplantation are limited, and current approaches may not detect early stages of rejection. Immunologic monitoring is also limited due to the lack of standardized markers for autoimmunity and rejection. Developing methods to detect graft dysfunction early on is crucial to allow for intervention and potentially rescue the graft.

----
[ISLET GRAFT SURVIVAL]
Islet graft function tends to decline over time, with most patients returning to insulin use. The use of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, such as exenatide, has shown promise in reducing insulin requirements, but its effects are not sustainable once discontinued. Non-immunologic mechanisms, including increased metabolic demand and immunosuppressant toxicity, may contribute to gradual graft loss.

----
[IMMUNOSUPPRESSION TOXICITY]
Newer immunosuppressant drug combinations have reduced toxicity, but the ideal goal is to withdraw immunosuppressive drugs after an initial period. Tolerance to the graft must be induced, and co-stimulation blockade has shown promise. Belatacept, a potent new CTLA4-Ig, has shown encouraging results in primate models and is being tested in human clinical trials.

----
[ISLET TRANSPLANTATION BENEFITS AND RISKS]
