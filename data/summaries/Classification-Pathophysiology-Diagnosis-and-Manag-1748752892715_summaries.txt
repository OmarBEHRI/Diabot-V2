[DIABETES DEFINITION]
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of chronic hyperglycemia, accompanied by impairment in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It is a condition that has been known to man for over 3000 years, with the first reported case found in an Egyptian manuscript. The origin and etiology of DM can vary greatly, but always include defects in either insulin secretion or response, or in both. DM is probably one of the oldest diseases known to man.

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
There are different types of diabetes, including Type 1 diabetes, which is immune-mediated or idiopathic, and Type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of DM, characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative insulin deficiency. Other forms of diabetes include gestational diabetes, which is related to the gestational hormonal environment, and diabetes caused by genetic defects, infections, and certain drugs. Type 2 DM results from the interaction between genetic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors.

----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The epidemiology of DM has provided valuable information on the natural history, prevalence, incidence, morbidity, and mortality of the disease in diverse populations around the world. According to the International Diabetes Federation Report of 2011, an estimated 366 million people had DM, and this number is expected to increase to around 552 million by 2030. The study of epidemiology can help identify the cause of the disease and possible preventive measures to arrest or delay its onset.

----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS]
There are different approaches to diagnose diabetes, including the 1997 ADA recommendations, which focus on fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), and the WHO recommendations, which focus on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is of great significance in averting any long-term complications of the disease. The diagnosis of DM is crucial for the management and treatment of the condition.
----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The incidence of diabetes varies across different populations, with the lowest rate found in China (0.1 per 105 per year) and the highest in Finland (37 per 105 per year). The incidence increases with age, peaking at puberty, and remains high in young adult males up to 29-35 years old. Approximately 50% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed, highlighting the need for early detection to reduce complications. The risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus has been updated to consolidate etiological views, replacing old terms such as insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) with a new system that identifies four types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, "other specific types", and gestational diabetes. This new classification system aims to provide a clearer understanding of the etiology of diabetes.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by beta cell destruction caused by an autoimmune process, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This type of diabetes is usually marked by the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell, or insulin antibodies, which identify the autoimmune processes that lead to beta cell destruction. Eventually, all Type 1 diabetic patients will require insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus comprises 80-90% of all diabetes cases and is often associated with intra-abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This type of diabetes is highly associated with a family history of diabetes, older age, obesity, and lack of exercise, and is more common in women, especially those with a history of gestational diabetes, and in certain ethnic groups such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
Gestational diabetes mellitus is an operational classification that identifies women who develop diabetes during pregnancy, including those with undiagnosed asymptomatic Type 2 diabetes that is discovered during pregnancy. This type of diabetes is a significant concern due to its potential impact on both the mother and the fetus.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Type 2 diabetes carries a high risk of large vessel atherosclerosis, commonly associated with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and obesity, leading to cardiovascular complications and end-stage renal disease. Geographical variation can contribute to the magnitude of these problems and overall morbidity and mortality. Most patients with type 2 diabetes die from these complications.

----
[PATHOGENESIS OF DIABETES]
There is a direct link between hyperglycemia and physiological and behavioral responses, where the brain recognizes hyperglycemia and sends a message to the pancreas and other organs to decrease its effect. This highlights the importance of managing blood glucose levels in diabetes care.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages infiltrating the islets. This autoimmune destruction is marked by the presence of immuno-competent and accessory cells in infiltrated pancreatic islets, association with class II genes of the major histocompatibility complex, and the presence of islet cell-specific autoantibodies.

----
[CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES]
Diabetes mellitus can be classified into several types, including type 1, type 2, and other specific types, such as genetic defects in β-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, and disease of the exocrine pancreas. Each type has distinct characteristics and underlying causes, highlighting the complexity of diabetes diagnosis and management.

----
[GENETIC DEFECTS AND DIABETES]
Genetic defects can play a significant role in the development of diabetes, particularly in monogenic diabetes, where defects in β-cell function or insulin action can lead to diabetes. Examples of genetic defects associated with diabetes include chromosome 12, HNF-1α (MODY 3), and mitochondrial DNA mutations.

----
[OTHER FORMS OF DIABETES]
Other forms of diabetes include disease of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, pharmacologically or chemically induced diabetes, infections, and infrequent forms of autoimmune diabetes. These forms of diabetes can have distinct clinical characteristics and underlying causes, requiring tailored diagnosis and management approaches.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
Gestational diabetes mellitus occurs mostly in women during gestation, highlighting the importance of diabetes screening and management during pregnancy to prevent adverse outcomes for both mother and child.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetes is associated with various complications, including macrovascular disease, impaired growth and development, and associated autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and celiac disease. Additionally, patients with diabetes are at risk of developing lipodystrophy, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These complications can have a significant impact on the quality of life and management of diabetes.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus involves screening patients with risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and a family history of diabetes. Early intervention can potentially reduce future complication rates, and diagnosis can be made using various tests, including fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, and random plasma test. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends using fasting plasma glucose for diagnosis, while the World Health Organization (WHO) focuses on the oral glucose tolerance test.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS]
Diagnostic tests for diabetes include the random plasma test, which does not require fasting and indicates diabetes if blood glucose is 200 mg/dl or higher, and the fasting plasma glucose test, which requires an 8-hour fast and confirms diabetes if blood glucose is 126 mg/dl or higher on two or more tests. These tests are essential for diagnosing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and for initiating appropriate treatment and management.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETES]
The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the pathophysiology of hyperglycemia and increased circulating fatty acids in type 2 diabetes are complex processes involving the failure of beta-cell insulin secretion and the resulting loss of glucose regulation. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing effective treatment and management strategies for diabetes.
----
[ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST]
The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted when the random plasma glucose test is 160-200 mg/dl and the fasting plasma test is 110-125 mg/dl. This test evaluates the body's response to glucose and requires fasting for 8-16 hours. The test involves giving 75 gm of glucose and testing blood glucose levels every 30 minutes to 1 hour for 2-3 hours. A glucose level of less than 140 mg/dl at 2 hours is considered normal.

----
[GLYCATED PROTEINS]
Glycated proteins are formed when proteins react with glucose in the blood, and their concentration can be measured to reflect blood glucose fluctuations over time. The extent of glycation is controlled by glucose concentration and the number of reactive amino groups in the protein. Glycated proteins with a longer lifetime in the blood are of interest for clinical diagnosis, as they reflect exposure to glucose over longer periods.

----
[GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN]
Glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) is a ketoamine compound formed by the combination of hemoglobin A and glucose, with a lifetime of 90-120 days. HbA1c is a retrospective indicator of average glucose concentration and is recommended for monitoring blood glucose control. A blood HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher is considered diagnostic for diabetes.

----
[DIABETES SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS]
Patients at risk for diabetes should be screened every 2 years, and those with prediabetes or diabetes should have their fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin levels checked regularly. The suggested approach to screening involves confirming diagnosis, implementing lifestyle changes, and considering metformin treatment depending on the degree of hyperglycemia.

----
[DIABETES TREATMENT IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS]
Hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia but not critically ill should have their glycated hemoglobin measured, and those with type 1 or 2 diabetes should continue their outpatient regimen if glucose is well-controlled. Basal insulin doses may be initiated or adjusted, and correction insulin may be given for blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl.
----
[FRUCTOSAMINE TEST]
The fructosamine test measures glycated albumin, which serves as a marker to monitor blood glucose levels, providing a retrospective measure of average blood glucose concentration over a period of 1 to 3 weeks. The reference interval for glycated albumin is 205-285 micro mol/L. This test can be used to assess blood glucose control. Glycated albumin is formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and albumin in plasma.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is made if two or more of the plasma glucose values are met or exceeded. Women at high risk should be screened as soon as feasible, and if the initial screening is negative, they should undergo retesting at 24-48 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test should be performed at least 6 weeks after pregnancy ends to reclassify the woman as having diabetes, normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose.
----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dl, and increased glycated hemoglobin (IGH) is defined as a glycated hemoglobin level of 5.7 to 6.4%. The diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed with a repeat test on a separate day or by an alternative test. Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is crucial in managing diabetes and preventing long-term complications.
----
[GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT AND RISK FACTORS]
Glycemic management is a significant challenge in addressing the needs of individuals with chronic illnesses like diabetes. Strict metabolic control can delay or prevent the progression of complications associated with diabetes. Several risk factors are associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, including insulin resistance, family history, ethnicity, and maternal gestational diabetes.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Glycemic control is crucial in delaying the onset and slowing the progression of microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Additionally, preventing complications, disability limitation, and rehabilitation are essential aspects of diabetes care. Poor adherence to treatment regimens due to poor attitude towards the disease and poor health literacy can hinder effective management. 

----
[GLYCEMIC GOALS AND INSULIN THERAPY]
Glycemic targets should be determined based on individual factors, including psychosocial limitations, and may need to be relaxed in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. Insulin therapy is indicated for type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes with insulinopenia, and can be the most effective blood glucose-lowering therapy. Many patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require insulin therapy, with potential high insulin requirements due to insulin resistance.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES]
The high prevalence of diabetes imposes a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and individuals, emphasizing the need for preventive and curative measures. Lifestyle modification plays a key role in diabetes management, and implementation of measures such as providing caloric content information and reducing high-calorie food availability can contribute to prevention and treatment efforts.

----
[FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN DIABETES CARE]
The growing number of undiagnosed patients and the impact of diabetes on patient quality of life and healthcare costs highlight the need for continued research and implementation of preventive and curative measures. Basic science research is essential in pointing prevention and treatment in new directions, and collaborative efforts are necessary to address the challenges posed by diabetes.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS]
The American Diabetes Association (2010) provides guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus, which includes Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The diagnosis of diabetes is based on plasma glucose levels, and the classification is important for determining the appropriate treatment. The guidelines also discuss the role of glycated hemoglobin (A1c) in the diagnosis of diabetes.

----
[DIABETES PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
The pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus involves a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Research has shown that the onset of Type 2 diabetes occurs at least 4-7 years before clinical diagnosis, highlighting the importance of early detection and prevention. The role of glucagon in the pathogenesis of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in diabetes has also been studied.

----
[DIABETES TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT]
The American Diabetes Association (2011, 2012) provides standards of medical care in diabetes, which include guidelines for the treatment and management of diabetes. Intensive blood-glucose control with sulphonylureas or insulin has been shown to reduce the risk of complications in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The importance of psychosocial care in diabetes management has also been recognized, with studies highlighting the need for improved psychosocial support for patients with diabetes.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS AND RISK FACTORS]
Diabetes is associated with several microvascular and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. Research has identified several biomarkers that can predict the risk of developing diabetes, including glycated hemoglobin and other serum biomarkers. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and other studies have demonstrated the importance of intensive blood-glucose control in preventing the progression of diabetic complications.

----
[DIABETES CARE AND EDUCATION]
Improving chronic illness care and translating evidence into action are crucial for effective diabetes management. The importance of patient education and self-management has been recognized, with studies highlighting the need for improved education and support for patients with diabetes. The role of healthcare providers in providing high-quality care and education to patients with diabetes is also critical.
