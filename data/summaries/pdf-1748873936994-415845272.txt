[INTRODUCTION TO DIABETES REPORT]
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a report on the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This report is the result of a WHO consultation and provides a comprehensive overview of diabetes diagnosis and classification. The report is divided into parts, with the first part focusing on diagnosis and classification. It is published by the Department of Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance in Geneva.

----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION]
The report provides a framework for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus, which is essential for healthcare professionals to accurately identify and manage the condition. The classification of diabetes is crucial for determining the best course of treatment and for predicting potential complications. The report aims to standardize the diagnosis and classification of diabetes worldwide. This will help improve diabetes care and treatment outcomes globally.

----
[WHO CONSULTATION OVERVIEW]
The WHO consultation brought together experts in the field of diabetes to discuss and agree on the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus. The consultation resulted in a comprehensive report that provides guidance on diabetes diagnosis and classification. The report is intended for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers involved in diabetes care and management. It is an essential resource for anyone working in the field of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
Diabetes mellitus is a condition characterized by glucose intolerance, with diagnostic criteria including fasting plasma or blood glucose concentrations. The definition and diagnosis of diabetes are crucial for proper management and treatment. Diagnostic criteria have undergone changes, with updates in the diagnostic value for fasting plasma/blood glucose concentrations.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes has evolved, with earlier classifications being revised to better reflect the different types and stages of the disease. The revised classification system includes terminology and application guidelines to help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage diabetes. This classification system is essential for developing effective treatment plans.

----
[CLINICAL STAGING OF DIABETES]
The clinical staging of diabetes mellitus and other categories of glucose tolerance is critical for understanding the progression of the disease. Diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose regulation, and normoglycaemia are distinct stages, each with its characteristics and management strategies. Impaired glucose regulation includes impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia, which are intermediate stages between normoglycaemia and diabetes.

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Diabetes can be classified into several aetiological types, including Type 1, Type 2, and other specific types. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, while Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Other specific types of diabetes are listed in Table 3 and are essential to consider for proper diagnosis and treatment.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational hyperglycaemia and diabetes are conditions that occur during pregnancy, with diagnosis and management critical for both mother and fetus. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is essential to prevent complications and ensure the best possible outcomes for both parties. Diagnostic criteria and management strategies for gestational diabetes are unique and require special consideration.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further classified into autoimmune diabetes mellitus and idiopathic types. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly marked by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, infections, and uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus. These types of diabetes are less common but still important to recognize and manage appropriately. They may have distinct causes and treatment approaches compared to Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

----
[METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The metabolic syndrome is a condition related to diabetes, although its definition and future needs are still being studied and refined. It is often associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Understanding the metabolic syndrome is important for diabetes education and care, as it can help identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes and related complications.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS]
The oral glucose tolerance test is a diagnostic tool used to assess glucose metabolism and diagnose diabetes, as described in Annex 1. Additionally, various methods for measuring substances in blood and urine are available, as outlined in Annex 2, which can aid in the diagnosis and management of diabetes. These tests are essential for determining the presence and type of diabetes, as well as monitoring treatment effectiveness.
