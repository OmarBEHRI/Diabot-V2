[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetes is associated with various complications, including macrovascular disease, impaired growth and development, and associated autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and celiac disease. Additionally, patients with diabetes are at risk of developing lipodystrophy, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These complications can have a significant impact on the quality of life and management of diabetes.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus involves screening patients with risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and a family history of diabetes. Early intervention can potentially reduce future complication rates, although randomized trials are lacking to definitively show benefit. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends using Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) for diagnosis, while the World Health Organization (WHO) focuses on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES]
There are several diagnostic tests for diabetes, including a random plasma test, which is the simplest test and doesn't require fasting. The fasting plasma glucose test requires an 8-hour fast and a blood glucose level of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests to confirm a diabetes diagnosis. These tests are crucial for identifying patients with diabetes and initiating appropriate management.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS]
Early diagnosis of diabetes is essential, as approximately 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes already have microvascular complications at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that they have had the disease for more than 5 years. Early intervention can help reduce the risk of complications and improve patient outcomes. Screening for diabetes in patients with risk factors can help identify those who require further evaluation and management.
----
[ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST]
The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted when the random plasma glucose test is 160-200 mg/dl and the fasting plasma test is 110-125 mg/dl. This test evaluates the body's response to glucose and requires fasting for 8-16 hours. The test involves giving 75 gm of glucose and testing blood glucose levels every 30 minutes to 1 hour for 2-3 hours. A glucose level of less than 140 mg/dl at 2 hours is considered normal.

----
[GLYCATED PROTEINS]
Glycated proteins are formed when proteins react with glucose in the blood, and the extent of glycation is controlled by glucose concentration and the number of reactive amino groups in the protein. Glycated proteins can be measured in blood and serve as a marker for fluctuations in blood glucose concentrations over a certain period. Proteins with longer lifetimes in the blood are of interest for clinical diagnosis, as they reflect exposure to glucose over longer periods.

----
[GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN]
Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a retrospective indicator of average glucose concentration and is recommended for monitoring blood glucose control. HbA1c is formed when hemoglobin A combines with glucose, and its lifespan is 90-120 days. A blood HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher is considered indicative of diabetes. HbA1c should be checked every 2 years, along with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), to monitor glycemic control.

----
[DIABETES SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS]
The suggested approach to screening patients at risk for diabetes involves checking FPG, glycated hemoglobin, or both every 2 years. If diabetes is suspected, the test should be repeated in 1-3 years. For patients with prediabetes, lifestyle changes should be implemented, and FPG and glycated hemoglobin should be checked in 12 months. If diabetes is confirmed, treatment should be initiated, and glycemic control should be monitored regularly.

----
[MANAGING HYPERGLYCEMIA IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS]
For hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia but not critically ill, glycated hemoglobin should be measured. If the patient has type 1 or type 2 diabetes, or is newly diagnosed, their outpatient regimen should be continued if glucose is well-controlled. If glucose is not well-controlled, basal insulin should be initiated, and correction insulin should be given for blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl. Oral agents should be discontinued if necessary, and insulin therapy should be adjusted accordingly.
----
[FRUCTOSAMINE TEST]
The fructosamine test measures glycated albumin, which serves as a marker to monitor blood glucose levels, providing a retrospective measure of average blood glucose concentration over a period of 1 to 3 weeks. The reference interval for glycated albumin is 205-285 micro mol/L. This test can be used to monitor blood glucose control. Glycated albumin is formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and albumin in plasma.
----
[DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is made if two or more of the plasma glucose values are met or exceeded. Women at high risk should be screened as soon as feasible, and if the initial screening is negative, they should undergo retesting at 24-48 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test should be performed at least 6 weeks after pregnancy ends to reclassify the woman as having diabetes, normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose.
----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND COMPLICATIONS]
The risk of complications of diabetes may differ according to the method of diagnosis, with glycated hemoglobin level potentially being a better predictor of certain complications, especially cardiovascular disease. Ongoing research is assessing the value of risk scores that incorporate glycemic measures, biomarkers, and risk factors to estimate diabetes risk. The method of diagnosis, whether by fasting plasma glucose testing or glycated hemoglobin testing, may impact the risk of diabetes and its complications.
----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE AND DIAGNOSIS]
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dl, and increased glycated hemoglobin (IGH) is defined as a glycated hemoglobin level of 5.7 to 6.4%. The diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed with a repeat test on a separate day or by an alternative test, and patients with prediabetic results should be counseled or treated for pre-diabetes. If the result of the repeat test is entirely normal, rescreening in 6 months should be considered.
----
[GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT]
Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is crucial for individuals with diabetes to prevent long-term complications. Strict metabolic control can delay or prevent the progression of complications associated with diabetes. Studies have shown that controlling insulin resistance, which is often associated with obesity, can help manage diabetes. Regular monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are essential for effective glycemic control.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Glycemic control is crucial in delaying the onset and slowing the progression of microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Adequate glycemic control, along with preventing complications, disability limitation, and rehabilitation, are essential needs for diabetic patients. Poor adherence to treatment regimens due to poor attitude towards the disease and poor health literacy can hinder effective management. 
----
[DETERMINING GLYCEMIC GOALS]
Glycemic goals should be determined by considering factors such as psychosocial limitations. In patients with "hypoglycemia unawareness," glycemic targets should be relaxed for prolonged periods, pending potential reversal of the condition. For patients with severe coexisting conditions, the goal is to prevent clinically significant glycosuria, water and electrolyte loss, infections, and non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma.
----
[INSULIN THERAPY]
Insulin is indicated for type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetic patients with insulinopenia whose hyperglycemia does not respond to diet therapy or oral hypoglycemic drugs. Controlling blood glucose with insulin has the potential to be the most effective blood glucose-lowering therapy. Many patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require insulin therapy, with insulin requirements potentially exceeding 1 unit/kg/day due to insulin resistance.
----
[FUTURE CHALLENGES IN DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
The high prevalence of diabetes imposes a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and individuals living with the disease. Implementing preventive and curative measures, such as lifestyle modifications and providing nutritional information, is essential to address the growing number of undiagnosed patients and the impact of diabetes on patient quality of life and healthcare costs.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes mellitus can be classified into different types, including Type 1 and Type 2, with distinct pathophysiology and management approaches. The American Diabetes Association provides guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus. According to the American Diabetes Association (2010), the classification of diabetes is based on the underlying pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

----
[DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING]
Diagnosis of diabetes involves screening tests such as the A1c assay, which is a widely accepted method for diagnosing diabetes. The International Expert Committee report (2009) highlights the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes. Additionally, other biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin can be used to predict the risk of developing diabetes in non-diabetic adults.

----
[COMPLICATIONS AND RISK FACTORS]
Diabetes can lead to various complications, including microvascular and macrovascular diseases. The development of these complications can be prevented or delayed with intensive blood-glucose control, as shown in studies such as the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS 33) and the ADVANCE Collaborative Group study. Understanding the risk factors and mechanisms of diabetic complications is crucial for effective management and prevention.

----
[TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT]
The management of diabetes involves a comprehensive approach, including lifestyle modifications, medication, and ongoing monitoring. The American Diabetes Association provides standards of medical care in diabetes, which include guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and management. Intensive insulin therapy and blood-glucose control can prevent the progression of diabetic microvascular complications, as demonstrated in studies such as the Ohkubo et al. (1995) study.

----
[PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE]
Psychosocial care is an essential aspect of diabetes management, and improving psychosocial care can have a positive impact on patient outcomes. The Indian experience, as reported by Shobana et al. (2005), highlights the importance of addressing psychosocial factors in diabetes care. Effective psychosocial care can help patients manage their condition and improve their quality of life.
