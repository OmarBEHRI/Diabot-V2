[INTRODUCTION TO DIABETES REPORT]
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a report on the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This report is part of the organization's efforts to provide a global standard for diabetes care and management. The report is divided into parts, with the first part focusing on the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus. It is published by the Department of Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance in Geneva.

----
[REPORT STRUCTURE AND PURPOSE]
The report is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of diabetes diagnosis and classification, aiming to facilitate consistent and accurate diagnosis worldwide. The purpose of the report is to guide healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing diabetes, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The report's content is based on a consultation by the WHO, ensuring that the information is evidence-based and up-to-date.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION IMPORTANCE]
The classification of diabetes mellitus is crucial for effective management and treatment of the condition. Accurate diagnosis and classification enable healthcare providers to develop personalized treatment plans, improving patient care and outcomes. The WHO report provides a standardized framework for diabetes classification, helping to reduce inconsistencies in diagnosis and treatment worldwide.
----
[DIABETES DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
Diabetes mellitus is a condition characterized by glucose intolerance, and its diagnosis is based on specific criteria. The definition and diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus and other categories of glucose intolerance are essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. The diagnostic criteria include fasting plasma/blood glucose concentrations and other factors.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
Diagnosis of diabetes involves various methods, including diagnosis in children, and individual diagnosis based on epidemiological studies. The diagnosis of diabetes is crucial for early intervention and management of the condition. Diagnostic criteria have undergone changes, including updates in fasting plasma/blood glucose concentrations.

----
[CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES]
The classification of diabetes has evolved over time, with earlier classifications being revised to reflect new understanding of the condition. The revised classification includes new terminology and application of the classification system. The classification of diabetes is essential for proper diagnosis, treatment, and management of the condition.

----
[CLINICAL STAGING OF DIABETES]
The clinical staging of diabetes mellitus and other categories of glucose tolerance is critical for understanding the progression of the condition. The stages include diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose regulation, and normoglycaemia. Each stage has distinct characteristics and requires specific management and treatment approaches.

----
[AETIOLOGICAL TYPES OF DIABETES]
Diabetes can be classified into various aetiological types, including Type 1, Type 2, and other specific types. Each type has distinct causes and characteristics, and understanding these types is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. The aetiological types of diabetes are crucial for developing effective management and treatment plans.

----
[GESTATIONAL HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND DIABETES]
Gestational hyperglycaemia and diabetes are conditions that occur during pregnancy, and their diagnosis is critical for the health of both the mother and the baby. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves specific criteria and methods, and early diagnosis is essential for proper management and treatment.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further classified into autoimmune diabetes mellitus and idiopathic types. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly marked by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, infections, and uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus. These types of diabetes are less common but still important to recognize and manage properly. They may have distinct causes and require specialized treatment approaches.

----
[THE METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The metabolic syndrome is a condition related to diabetes, but its definition and future needs are still being studied and refined. The metabolic syndrome is likely to be an important area of focus in diabetes care and education, as it can have significant implications for patient health and treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to fully understand the metabolic syndrome and its relationship to diabetes.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION HISTORY]
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Diabetes Data Group introduced new diagnostic criteria and a classification system for diabetes mellitus in the late 1970s, bringing order to a previously chaotic situation. The WHO modified their criteria in 1985 to align with the NDDG values. Since then, a significant amount of data and aetiological information has become available, prompting a re-examination of the classification and criteria. This led to updates and refinements in the field of diabetes diagnosis.

----
[UPDATE ON DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
In 1997, an American Diabetes Association (ADA) expert group published recommendations on diagnostic criteria and classification, which were similar to the conclusions reached by a WHO Consultation held in 1996. The WHO Consultation's provisional report was released, and after considering comments, a final report was prepared by Professors K.G.M.M. Alberti and P.Z. Zimmet. The report was made possible with financial support from several organizations, including Bayer and Novo Nordisk.
----
[DIABETES DEFINITION]
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia and disturbances in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. This condition can lead to long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs. The effects of diabetes mellitus can be severe, including ketoacidosis, non-ketotic hyperosmolar state, and even death if left untreated.

----
[DIABETES SYMPTOMS]
Diabetes mellitus may present with characteristic symptoms such as thirst, polyuria, blurring of vision, and weight loss. However, symptoms may not always be severe or present, and hyperglycaemia can cause pathological and functional changes for a long time before diagnosis. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to severe complications, including stupor, coma, and death.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
The long-term effects of diabetes mellitus include the development of specific complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, which can lead to blindness, renal failure, foot ulcers, amputation, and autonomic dysfunction. Additionally, people with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, and cerebrovascular disease, making timely diagnosis and treatment crucial.
----
[PATHOGENETIC PROCESSES]
The development of diabetes involves several pathogenetic processes, including the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency, and processes that result in resistance to insulin action. These abnormalities affect carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism due to insufficient insulin action on target tissues. This can be caused by insensitivity or a lack of insulin.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
A diagnosis of diabetes must be made with confidence, considering the lifelong consequences for the individual. The diagnostic criteria differ for individuals presenting with severe symptoms and hyperglycaemia versus those who are asymptomatic with slightly elevated blood glucose values. Severe hyperglycaemia under stress may be transitory and should not be considered diagnostic of diabetes on its own.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION]
For an asymptomatic person, a single abnormal blood glucose value is not sufficient for a diagnosis of diabetes. At least one additional plasma or blood glucose test result in the diabetic range is necessary, which can be from a fasting sample, a random sample, or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If initial tests are inconclusive, periodic re-testing is advised to confirm the diagnosis.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS]
When deciding on a diagnostic or therapeutic course of action for diabetes, healthcare providers should consider additional factors such as ethnicity, family history, age, adiposity, and concomitant disorders. These factors can help inform the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Glycated haemoglobin has been explored as an alternative to blood glucose estimation or the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for diagnosing diabetes. However, its use is not yet widely recommended due to limited availability and standardization.

----
[DIABETES IN CHILDREN]
Diabetes in children often presents with severe symptoms, including very high blood glucose levels, marked glycosuria, and ketonuria. In most cases, the diagnosis is confirmed quickly through blood glucose measurements, and treatment, including insulin injection, is initiated immediately. An OGTT is not necessary or appropriate for diagnosis in these circumstances. However, some children and adolescents may present with less severe symptoms and require additional diagnostic tests, such as fasting blood glucose measurement and/or an OGTT.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The clinical diagnosis of diabetes is often prompted by symptoms such as increased thirst and urine volume, recurrent infections, unexplained weight loss, and, in severe cases, drowsiness and coma. High levels of glycosuria are usually present in individuals with diabetes. A single blood glucose estimation in excess of a certain threshold can also be used to diagnose diabetes. These diagnostic criteria help healthcare providers identify individuals with diabetes and initiate appropriate treatment.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes can be established based on diagnostic values indicated in Figure 1, with levels of blood glucose below which a diagnosis of diabetes is unlikely in non-pregnant individuals. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is only necessary if casual blood glucose values are in the uncertain range and fasting blood glucose levels are below those that establish the diagnosis of diabetes. The diagnostic criteria for children are the same as for adults.

----
[ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (OGTT) PROCEDURE]
For clinical purposes, an OGTT involves measuring blood glucose values while fasting and at 2 hours after a 75g oral glucose load for adults, and 1.75g per kg for children. The test is used to establish diagnostic status when casual blood glucose values are uncertain.

----
[CHANGES IN DIAGNOSTIC VALUES FOR FASTING PLASMA/GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS]
The diagnostic value for fasting plasma glucose concentration has been lowered to 7.0 mmol l-1 (126 mg dl-1) and above, from the former level of 7.8 mmol l-1 (140 mg dl-1) and above. For whole blood, the proposed new level is 6.1 mmol l-1 (110 mg dl-1) and above, from the former 6.7 mmol l-1 (120 mg dl-1).

----
[DIAGNOSTIC INTERPRETATIONS]
Diagnostic interpretations of the fasting and 2-h post-load concentrations in non-pregnant subjects are shown in Table 1, providing a reference for healthcare professionals to diagnose and manage diabetes. The new fasting criterion is chosen to represent a value which is at the upper end of the range that corresponds in diagnostic significance to that of the 2-h post-load concentration.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The optimal cut-off point for diagnosing diabetes is a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol l–1 (126 mg dl–1) or higher, which represents an increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular disease. This cut-off point is based on several population-based studies and is used to separate the components of bimodal frequency distributions of fasting plasma glucose concentrations. However, in certain populations, such as the elderly or less obese individuals, lower fasting glucose levels may be seen in persons with diagnostic 2-h post-load glucose values.

----
[EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES]
Epidemiological studies of glucose intolerance and diabetes often classify individuals based on their blood glucose concentration measured after an overnight fast and/or 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose load. While 2-h values are considered the single best choice, fasting plasma glucose alone may be used for epidemiological purposes if an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not possible. However, it has been shown that some individuals identified by fasting values differ from those identified by 2-h post-glucose challenge values, particularly in certain populations such as the elderly and those with less obesity.

----
[POPULATION VARIATIONS]
The diagnostic criteria for diabetes may vary across different populations, with certain groups such as Asian populations and the elderly having different fasting glucose levels despite having diagnostic 2-h post-load glucose values. Middle-aged, more obese individuals, on the other hand, may be more accurately diagnosed using fasting plasma glucose values. These variations highlight the importance of considering population-specific factors when diagnosing and managing diabetes.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
Patients are more likely to have diagnostic fasting values, and the overall population prevalence may or may not differ when estimates using fasting and 2-hour values are compared. The diagnosis of diabetes should be based on multiple factors, including symptoms and blood/plasma determinations. A single glucose determination is not sufficient for diagnosis.

----
[INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSIS REQUIREMENTS]
The diagnosis of diabetes in individuals requires confirmatory symptoms or blood/plasma determinations, and should not be based on a single glucose determination. Both the 2-hour and fasting values should be used to identify people at risk for development of complications, allowing for early preventive strategies.

----
[COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES]
The recommendations for individual diagnosis contrast with those of the ADA Expert Committee, which gives primacy to the fasting plasma glucose. This highlights the importance of considering multiple factors and guidelines when diagnosing diabetes.
----
[EARLY CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES]
The first widely accepted classification of diabetes mellitus was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980, which included clinical classes and statistical risk classes. This classification proposed two major classes of diabetes mellitus: IDDM (Type 1) and NIDDM (Type 2). The 1985 classification introduced a new class called Malnutrition-related Diabetes Mellitus (MRDM) and retained the classes IDDM and NIDDM. This classification was widely accepted and used internationally.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM]
The 1985 classification system represented a compromise between clinical and aetiological classification, allowing for the classification of individual subjects and patients in a clinically useful manner. The system included staging of diabetes mellitus based on clinical descriptive criteria and a complementary aetiological classification. This classification system was reflected in the International Nomenclature of Diseases (IND) in 1991 and the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) in 1992. It provided a useful framework for diagnosing and managing diabetes.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus encompasses both clinical stages and aetiological types, reflecting the progression of the disease through several clinical stages regardless of its aetiology. This classification allows for the categorization of individuals with diabetes according to clinical characteristics, even without information on the underlying aetiology. The clinical staging reflects the various degrees of hyperglycaemia in individual subjects with any of the disease processes that may lead to diabetes mellitus.

----
[CLINICAL STAGING]
The clinical staging of diabetes allows for the categorization of all subjects with diabetes mellitus according to the degree of hyperglycaemia, which may change over time depending on the extent of the underlying disease processes. This staging is achievable in all circumstances, and individuals may move from one stage to another in either direction. The clinical stage reflects the current state of the disease, regardless of the underlying aetiology.

----
[AETIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION]
The aetiological classification of diabetes reflects the improved understanding of the causes of the disease, allowing for the categorization of individuals according to the underlying defect or disease process. This classification recognizes that the disease process may be present but not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycaemia, and that individual subjects may have different underlying causes of their diabetes. The aetiological classification provides a framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the disease.
----
[EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF DIABETES]
The process leading to diabetes can be identifiable at any stage, even when blood sugar levels are normal. The presence of islet cell antibodies in a person with normal blood sugar levels can indicate the presence of the Type 1 autoimmune process. However, there are currently few specific indicators for the Type 2 process. 
----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND CONTROL]
The same disease processes that cause diabetes can also lead to impaired fasting glycaemia and/or impaired glucose tolerance. Some individuals with diabetes can achieve adequate blood sugar control through weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral medications, and may not require insulin. 
----
[INSULIN REQUIREMENT AND SURVIVAL]
Individuals with diabetes who have some residual insulin secretion can survive without insulin, but may still require it for adequate blood sugar control. Those with extensive beta-cell destruction and no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. 
----
[DISEASE PROGRESSION AND REGRESSION]
The severity of the metabolic abnormality in diabetes can change over time, either regressing with weight reduction, progressing with weight gain, or remaining the same.
----
[DIABETES TERMINOLOGY]
The terms "insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" and "non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" and their acronyms "IDDM" and "NIDDM" are no longer recommended for use, as they can be confusing and lead to misclassification of patients based on treatment rather than pathogenesis. Instead, the terms Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes should be used. This change in terminology aims to provide a clearer understanding of the different types of diabetes.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes encompasses cases primarily due to pancreatic islet beta-cell destruction and are prone to ketoacidosis, including those resulting from an autoimmune process and those with unknown aetiology or pathogenesis (idiopathic). This type does not include forms of beta-cell destruction or failure with specific causes, such as cystic fibrosis or mitochondrial defects.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by defects in insulin secretion, often accompanied by insulin resistance, and is the most common form of diabetes. A distinct lean phenotype of Type 2 diabetes has been identified in adults from the Indian subcontinent, which may differ from the more typical form of Type 2 diabetes found in other populations.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes has undergone changes, with the deletion of the "Malnutrition-related diabetes" (MRDM) class due to lack of convincing evidence that diabetes can be caused by malnutrition or protein deficiency. However, certain forms of diabetes, such as Protein-deficient Pancreatic Diabetes (PDPD), may be considered as malnutrition-modulated forms of diabetes. Further studies are needed to understand these conditions. 

----
[FORMER SUBTYPES OF MRDM]
The former subtype of MRDM, Fibrocalculous Pancreatic Diabetes (FCPD), is now classified as a disease of the exocrine pancreas, known as fibrocalculous pancreatopathy, which can lead to diabetes mellitus. This reclassification reflects a better understanding of the underlying causes of the condition. 

----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
The class "Impaired Glucose Tolerance" is now considered a stage of impaired glucose regulation, as it can be observed in any hyperglycemic disorder and is not a distinct form of diabetes. This change in classification reflects a more nuanced understanding of glucose regulation and its relationship to diabetes. 

----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLYCAEMIA]
A new clinical stage, Impaired Fasting Glycaemia, has been introduced to classify individuals with fasting glucose values above the normal range but below those diagnostic of diabetes. This stage helps identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes and allows for early intervention.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Gestational Diabetes is a classification that now includes the groups formerly known as Gestational Impaired Glucose Tolerance (GIGT) and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). This change in classification aims to simplify and streamline the diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes. The new classification encompasses a broader range of glucose tolerance impairments during pregnancy. This update reflects the evolving understanding of gestational diabetes and its implications for maternal and fetal health.

---- 
[IMPLICATIONS OF CLASSIFICATION CHANGE]
The revised classification of Gestational Diabetes has significant implications for diabetes care and education during pregnancy. Healthcare providers must be aware of the updated classification to provide accurate diagnoses and effective management plans for pregnant women with impaired glucose tolerance. This change may also impact the way gestational diabetes is screened, diagnosed, and treated, ultimately affecting maternal and fetal outcomes.
----
[DIABETES MELLITUS CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes mellitus is subdivided into three categories: insulin requiring for survival, insulin requiring for control, and not insulin requiring. The first category corresponds to the former clinical class of "Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus" and includes individuals who are C-peptide deficient. The latter two categories constitute the former class of Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM). Individuals with insulin requiring for control have some endogenous insulin secretion but require added exogenous insulin to achieve normoglycaemia.

----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE REGULATION]
Impaired glucose regulation refers to a metabolic state between normal glucose homeostasis and diabetes, and includes Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and Impaired Fasting Glycaemia (IFG). IGT and IFG represent different abnormalities of glucose regulation, one in the fasting state and one post-prandial, and are not interchangeable. This intermediate state is a significant consideration in diabetes care and education.
----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is now considered a stage in the natural history of disordered carbohydrate metabolism, rather than a distinct class. Individuals with IGT have an increased risk of progressing to diabetes and macrovascular disease. IGT is often associated with the Metabolic Syndrome, also known as Insulin Resistance Syndrome. This association may indicate an enhanced risk of cardiovascular disease.

----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE]
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) refers to fasting glucose concentrations that are higher than the normal reference range but lower than those required to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The values for IFG are a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 6.1 mmol l–1 (110 mg dl–1) or greater, but less than 7.0 mmol l–1 (126 mg dl–1). Individuals with IFG may have a similar cardiovascular disease risk factor profile to those with IGT.

----
[RISK CATEGORIES FOR DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
IGT and IFG are not clinical entities in their own right, but rather risk categories for future diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. Individuals who meet criteria for IGT or IFG may be euglycaemic in their daily lives, as shown by normal or near-normal glycated haemoglobin levels. These conditions can occur as an intermediate stage in any of the disease processes, serving as indicators or markers of enhanced risk.

----
[RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TESTING AND DIAGNOSIS]
It is recommended that all individuals with IFG have an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to exclude the diagnosis of diabetes, if resources allow. An OGTT can help determine if an individual with IFG has IGT or diabetes, which cannot be determined without the test. This can help identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
----
[DEFINING NORMOGLYCAEMIA]
A fasting venous plasma glucose concentration of less than 6.1 mmol l–1 (110 mg dl–1) is considered "normal" and is observed in people with proven normal glucose tolerance. However, some individuals with normal glucose tolerance may still have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) if an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is performed. Values above this threshold are associated with a greater risk of developing micro- and macrovascular complications.

----
[EARLY RECOGNITION AND PREVENTION]
The pathological processes that lead to diabetes mellitus can begin and be recognizable in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Early recognition of these processes may be useful in preventing progression to more advanced stages of the disease. Effective treatments or the natural history of some forms of diabetes mellitus can also result in reversion of hyperglycaemia to a state of normoglycaemia.

----
[CLASSIFICATION OF NORMOGLYCAEMIA]
A proposed classification includes a stage of normoglycaemia for individuals who have evidence of pathological processes that may lead to diabetes mellitus, or in whom a reversal of hyperglycaemia has occurred. This classification aims to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes and those who have successfully reversed their condition.
----
[DIABETES TYPE 1 CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the destruction of beta-cells, which can be detected before the disease is clinically manifest. This process is often autoimmune in nature, with the presence of anti-GAD, islet cell, or insulin antibodies. However, in some cases, particularly in non-Caucasians, no evidence of an autoimmune disorder is found, and these cases are classified as "Type 1 idiopathic". The aetiological Type 1 process can be identified and sub-categorized with appropriate antibody determinations.

----
[DIABETES TYPE 1 DIAGNOSIS]
The diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes involves detecting the process of beta-cell destruction, which can be done through antibody determinations. These measurements may not be available in all centers, but if performed, can help classify individual patients. The presence of anti-GAD, islet cell, or insulin antibodies can identify the autoimmune processes that lead to beta-cell destruction. This information can aid in the classification and management of Type 1 diabetes.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, characterized by disorders of insulin action and insulin secretion. Both insulin action and secretion disorders are usually present when Type 2 diabetes is clinically manifest. The specific reasons for the development of these abnormalities are not yet known. This form of diabetes is distinct due to its underlying insulin-related disorders.

----
[OTHER DIABETES TYPES]
Other specific types of diabetes are less common causes of diabetes mellitus, but can be identified by a specific underlying defect or disease process. These types include fibrocalculous pancreatopathy, a form of diabetes formerly classified as malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus. These specific types are distinct from Type 2 diabetes due to their identifiable underlying causes. They are listed in Table 3 for further reference.
----
[DEFINITION OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational diabetes is a condition characterized by carbohydrate intolerance and hyperglycemia that is first recognized during pregnancy, regardless of whether insulin is used for treatment or if the condition persists after pregnancy. This definition applies even if the glucose intolerance may have existed before pregnancy but was previously undiagnosed. Women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus before pregnancy are not considered to have gestational diabetes. 

----
[GLUCOSE LEVELS DURING PREGNANCY]
In the early stages of pregnancy, fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations are typically lower than in non-pregnant women. Elevated glucose levels during this time may indicate pre-existing diabetes, but specific criteria for designating abnormal glucose levels have not been established. 

----
[MANAGEMENT OF HIGH GLUCOSE LEVELS DURING PREGNANCY]
High plasma glucose levels during early pregnancy require careful management and may necessitate an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) to assess glucose tolerance. Normal glucose tolerance in the early part of pregnancy is an important consideration for managing gestational diabetes.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES RISK FACTORS]
Individuals at high risk for gestational diabetes include older women, those with a previous history of glucose intolerance, those with a history of large for gestational age babies, and women from certain high-risk ethnic groups. Pregnant women with elevated fasting or casual blood glucose levels are also at high risk. Screening for gestational diabetes may be appropriate during the first trimester for high-risk populations. 

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
To diagnose gestational diabetes, a standard Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) should be performed after overnight fasting, using 75g of anhydrous glucose in water. Plasma glucose is measured fasting and after 2 hours, and pregnant women who meet WHO criteria for diabetes mellitus or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) are classified as having Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). 

----
[POST-PREGNANCY FOLLOW-UP]
After pregnancy, women with gestational diabetes should be re-classified as having either diabetes mellitus, IGT, or normal glucose tolerance based on the results of a 75g OGTT six weeks or more after delivery. Regardless of the result, these women are at increased risk of subsequently developing diabetes. 

----
[IMPORTANCE OF FOLLOW-UP TESTING]
Any woman with Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) should have a 75g OGTT, although the significance of IFG in pregnancy remains to be established. Regular follow-up testing is crucial for women who have had gestational diabetes, as they are at higher risk of developing diabetes later in life.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterized by the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This form of diabetes can progress rapidly or slowly, with the rapid form commonly observed in children and the slow form generally occurring in adults. The slow progressive form is sometimes referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).

----
[INSULIN DEPENDENCY]
Patients with Type 1 diabetes often become dependent on insulin for survival, particularly as the disease progresses and beta-cell function is lost. Insulin treatment is necessary to prevent ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes may present with ketoacidosis as the first manifestation of the disease, or may experience it in response to infection or other stress.

----
[DIABETES PROGRESSION]
The progression of Type 1 diabetes can vary significantly from person to person, with some individuals experiencing rapid destruction of beta cells and others experiencing a slower decline in beta-cell function. Adults with Type 1 diabetes may retain residual beta-cell function for many years, preventing ketoacidosis, while children and adolescents are more likely to present with ketoacidosis as the first manifestation of the disease.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by little or no insulin secretion, resulting in low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide. Markers of immune destruction, such as islet cell autoantibodies, are present in 85-90% of individuals with Type 1 diabetes when fasting diabetic hyperglycaemia is initially detected. The peak incidence of this form of Type 1 diabetes occurs in childhood and adolescence, but the onset may occur at any age. 

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES RISK FACTORS]
There is a genetic predisposition to autoimmune destruction of beta cells, and it is also related to environmental factors that are still poorly defined. Although patients are usually not obese when they present with this type of diabetes, the presence of obesity is not incompatible with the diagnosis. Additionally, patients with Type 1 diabetes may also have other autoimmune disorders such as Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and Addison's disease.

----
[IDIOPATHIC TYPE 1 DIABETES]
There are some forms of Type 1 diabetes with no known aetiology, characterized by permanent insulinopenia and a propensity for ketoacidosis, but without evidence of autoimmunity. This form of diabetes is more common among individuals of African and Asian origin, and may have varying requirements for insulin replacement therapy, with some patients periodically developing ketoacidosis.
----
[TYPE DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency, or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Individuals with this type of diabetes often have relative insulin deficiency and are resistant to the action of insulin. This form of diabetes is frequently undiagnosed for many years due to mild hyperglycemia that may not provoke noticeable symptoms. As a result, patients are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES MECHANISMS AND CLASSIFICATION]
The specific mechanisms and aetiologies of Type 2 diabetes are not yet fully understood, but it is likely that advancements in identifying pathogenetic processes and genetic defects will lead to better differentiation and classification. Autoimmune destruction of the pancreas is not a characteristic of Type 2 diabetes, and patients do not have other known specific causes of diabetes. The classification of Type 2 diabetes may evolve as more specific causes are identified and patients are reclassified into "Other types" of diabetes.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES AND OBESITY]
The majority of patients with Type 2 diabetes are obese, and obesity is a significant contributor to insulin resistance. Even non-obese individuals with Type 2 diabetes may have an increased percentage of body fat distributed in the abdominal region, which can aggravate insulin resistance. This highlights the importance of considering body fat distribution and obesity in the management and treatment of Type 2 diabetes.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by defective and insufficient insulin secretion, despite often having normal or elevated insulin levels. High blood glucose levels in these patients would typically result in higher insulin values if beta-cell function were normal. Insulin resistance is a key factor, and insulin sensitivity can be increased through weight reduction, physical activity, and pharmacological treatment, but not restored to normal.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK FACTORS]
The risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity. It also occurs more frequently in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in individuals with hypertension or dyslipidaemia. The frequency of Type 2 diabetes varies among different racial and ethnic subgroups, and it is often associated with a strong familial, likely genetic, predisposition.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS]
Some patients presenting with a clinical picture consistent with Type 2 diabetes may have autoantibodies similar to those found in Type 1 diabetes, making it essential to conduct antibody determinations for accurate diagnosis. Patients who are non-obese, have relatives with Type 1 diabetes, or are of Northern European origin may be suspected of having late-onset Type 1 diabetes, rather than Type 2 diabetes.
----
[GENETIC DEFECTS IN BETA-CELL FUNCTION]
Genetic defects in beta-cell function can cause mild hyperglycemia at an early age, typically before 25 years old, and are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. These forms of diabetes, formerly known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), are characterized by impaired insulin secretion with minimal or no defect in insulin action. Abnormalities at specific genetic loci on different chromosomes have been identified as the cause of these defects.

----
[MONOGENIC FORMS OF DIABETES]
There are several monogenic forms of diabetes, including those associated with mutations on chromosome 12 in the HNF1 gene, chromosome 7p in the glucokinase gene, and chromosome 20q in the HNF4 gene. These mutations affect the regulation of insulin secretion, with glucokinase serving as the "glucose sensor" for the beta cell. Defects in the glucokinase gene require increased levels of glucose to elicit normal levels of insulin secretion.

----
[TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GENES AND DIABETES]

For patients without access to blood glucose monitoring, urine samples can be tested for glucose, especially for insulin-treated patients. Urine tests should be done after rising, before main meals, and before bed, but their value is limited due to variations in urine glucose concentration. Short-term fractions of urine output can improve the correlation between blood and urine glucose levels.

----
[KETONE BODY MONITORING]
The presence of ketone bodies in urine or blood, along with hyperglycaemia or high glycosuria, indicates a severe metabolic disturbance in diabetic patients. Patients should be advised to test for ketone bodies, such as acetone and aceto-acetic acid, when testing for glucose, especially if they have persistent ketonuria. This can help identify the need for urgent corrective action.
----
[DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS DETECTION]
Diabetic ketoacidosis can be detected through various methods, including Rothera's sodium nitroprusside test or reagent-strips sensitive to ketones. These tests can measure the concentration of plasma ketones, which is greatly raised in emergency situations such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Reagent-strips can also roughly quantify ketone levels through serial dilution of plasma with water.

----
[PLASMA KETONE MEASUREMENT]
Plasma ketone measurement is crucial in detecting diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in emergency situations. Reagent-strips can detect and roughly quantify plasma ketones, allowing for prompt diagnosis and treatment. This measurement is essential in assessing the severity of diabetic ketoacidosis and guiding treatment decisions.

[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The aetiological classification of disorders of glycaemia includes Type 1 diabetes, which is characterized by beta-cell destruction leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further divided into autoimmune and idiopathic categories. Type 2 diabetes is also classified, and may range from predominantly insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to a predominantly secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes are also recognized, including genetic defects and diseases of the exocrine pancreas.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be divided into two subcategories: autoimmune and idiopathic. Autoimmune Type 1 diabetes is an immune-mediated condition, while idiopathic Type 1 diabetes has no known cause.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous condition that may range from predominantly insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to a predominantly secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. This classification highlights the complexity of Type 2 diabetes and the need for individualized treatment approaches.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes. These types of diabetes are less common and may require specialized treatment and management.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy, and includes the former categories of gestational impaired glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes. This condition requires careful management to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus.
----
[CAUSES OF DIABETES]
Diabetes can be caused by various factors, including drug- or chemical-induced factors, infections, and congenital conditions such as rubella. Infections like cytomegalovirus can also contribute to the development of diabetes. Additionally, uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes, such as insulin autoimmune syndrome and "Stiff Man" syndrome, can also lead to diabetes.

----
[GENETIC SYNDROMES AND DIABETES]
Other genetic syndromes, as outlined in Table 5, can also increase the risk of developing diabetes. These syndromes may have a significant impact on the development and management of diabetes. It is essential to consider these genetic factors when diagnosing and treating diabetes. Further information on these syndromes can be found in Table 5.
----
[DRUG-INDUCED DIABETES]
Certain medications and chemicals can induce diabetes, including nicotinic acid, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormone. Other substances that may contribute to the development of diabetes include alpha-adrenergic agonists, beta-adrenergic agonists, and thiazides. These substances can impair insulin secretion or increase insulin resistance, leading to elevated blood glucose levels.

----
[SPECIFIC DRUGS ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES]
Specific drugs that have been linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes include Dilantin, pentamidine, and Vacor. Additionally, interferon-alpha therapy has also been associated with an increased risk of diabetes. These drugs can have a range of effects on glucose metabolism, from impairing insulin secretion to increasing glucose production in the liver.
----
[GENETIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES]
Certain genetic syndromes are sometimes associated with diabetes, including Down's syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's chorea. Other syndromes linked to diabetes include Klinefelter's syndrome, Lawrence-Moon-Biedel syndrome, and Myotonic dystrophy. These genetic conditions can increase the risk of developing diabetes, and individuals with these syndromes should be monitored for diabetes symptoms and risk factors.

----
[ADDITIONAL GENETIC SYNDROMES]
Additional genetic syndromes associated with diabetes include Porphyria, Prader-Willi syndrome, Turner's syndrome, and Wolfram's syndrome. These syndromes may have varying degrees of association with diabetes, and further evaluation is necessary to understand the specific relationships between these conditions and diabetes risk.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The diagnosis of diabetes can be determined using unstandardized blood glucose values, also known as casual or random blood glucose levels. These values are measured in mmol/L or mg/dL. The 1985 WHO Study Group Report provides a reference point for these values. 

----
[REFERENCE VALUES]
The 1985 WHO Study Group Report provides a standard reference for blood glucose values, which can be used to diagnose diabetes. The report includes a figure illustrating the unstandardized blood glucose values in mmol/L and mg/dL. This information serves as a guideline for healthcare professionals to diagnose and manage diabetes.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes can be classified into different stages, including normoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and diabetes mellitus, with further sub-classification into types such as Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is characterized as autoimmune or idiopathic, while Type 2 is predominantly marked by insulin resistance or insulin secretory defects. Other specific types of diabetes include gestational diabetes and rare instances of toxicity-induced diabetes.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that requires insulin for survival, and can also be idiopathic in nature. This type of diabetes is distinct from others, such as Type 2, and may present with different symptoms and treatment requirements. In some cases, patients with Type 1 diabetes may have unique circumstances, such as presentation during pregnancy.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by predominantly insulin resistance or insulin secretory defects, and may not always require insulin for control. However, in some instances, patients with Type 2 diabetes may require insulin therapy to manage their condition. This type of diabetes is distinct from Type 1 and other specific types, such as gestational diabetes.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy, and rare instances of toxicity-induced diabetes, such as Vacor toxicity. These types of diabetes may have unique characteristics and treatment requirements, and in some cases, may require insulin for survival. Patients with these types of diabetes require careful management and monitoring to control their condition.
