[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further classified into autoimmune diabetes mellitus and idiopathic types. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly marked by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes.

[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, infections, and uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus. These types of diabetes are less common but still important to recognize and manage appropriately. They may have distinct causes and risk factors, and their diagnosis and treatment may differ from those of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

[THE METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The metabolic syndrome is a condition that is often associated with diabetes, and its definition and future needs are important considerations in diabetes care and management. The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Understanding the metabolic syndrome is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for diabetes and related conditions.
