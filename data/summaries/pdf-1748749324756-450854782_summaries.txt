[DIABETES DEFINITION]
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of chronic hyperglycemia, accompanied by impairment in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It is a condition that has been known for thousands of years, with the first reported case in an Egyptian manuscript about 3000 years ago. The origin and etiology of DM can vary greatly, but always include defects in either insulin secretion or response, or in both. DM is probably one of the oldest diseases known to man.

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
There are different types of diabetes, including Type 1 diabetes, which is immune-mediated or idiopathic, and Type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of DM, characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative insulin deficiency. Type 2 DM results from the interaction between genetic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors. Other forms of diabetes include gestational diabetes, which is related to the gestational hormonal environment, and diabetes caused by genetic defects, infections, and certain drugs.

----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The epidemiology of DM has provided valuable information on the natural history, prevalence, incidence, morbidity, and mortality of the disease in diverse populations around the world. According to the International Diabetes Federation Report of 2011, an estimated 366 million people had DM, and this number is expected to increase to around 552 million by 2030. The study of epidemiology can help identify the cause of the disease and possible preventive measures to arrest or delay the onset of DM, which has reached epidemic proportions globally.

----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS]
There are different approaches to diagnose diabetes, including the 1997 ADA recommendations, which focus on fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), and the WHO, which focuses on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is of great significance in averting long-term complications of diabetes. The diagnosis of DM is crucial for the management and treatment of the disease, and healthcare providers play a vital role in this process.
----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The incidence of diabetes varies across different populations, with the lowest rate found in China (0.1 per 10^5 per year) and the highest in Finland (37 per 10^5 per year). The incidence increases with age, peaking at puberty, and then drops in young women but remains high in young adult males up to 29-35 years old. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people with diabetes will reach 552 million. Currently, around 50% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed, highlighting the need for early detection to reduce complications.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus has been updated to consolidate etiological views, replacing old terms like insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) with a new system that identifies four types: type 1, type 2, "other specific types," and gestational diabetes. This classification system aims to provide a clearer understanding of the etiology of diabetes mellitus.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS]
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by beta-cell destruction caused by an autoimmune process, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This type of diabetes is usually marked by the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell, or insulin antibodies, which identify the autoimmune processes that lead to beta-cell destruction. Eventually, all type 1 diabetic patients will require insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus comprises 80-90% of all cases of diabetes and is often associated with intra-abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This type of diabetes is highly associated with a family history of diabetes, older age, obesity, and lack of exercise, and is more common in women, especially those with a history of gestational diabetes, and in certain ethnic groups such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
Gestational diabetes mellitus is an operational classification that identifies women who develop diabetes mellitus during gestation, including those with undiagnosed asymptomatic type 2 diabetes that is discovered during pregnancy. This type of diabetes is a significant concern, as it can have implications for both the mother's and the baby's health.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Patients with type 2 diabetes are at a high risk of developing large vessel atherosclerosis, which is often associated with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and obesity, and can lead to cardiovascular complications and end-stage renal disease. Geographical variation can contribute to the magnitude of these problems and overall morbidity and mortality. Most patients with type 2 diabetes die from cardiovascular complications.

----
[PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
There is a direct link between hyperglycemia and physiological and behavioral responses, where the brain recognizes hyperglycemia and sends a message to the pancreas and other organs to decrease its effect. This highlights the importance of managing blood glucose levels to prevent complications.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages infiltrating the islets. This autoimmune response is associated with the presence of immuno-competent and accessory cells in infiltrated pancreatic islets, as well as the presence of islet cell-specific autoantibodies.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes can be classified into several types, including type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and other specific types such as genetic defects in β-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, and disease of the exocrine pancreas. Each type has distinct characteristics and underlying causes, and understanding these differences is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by a range of disorders, from relative insulin deficiency to disorders of insulin secretion and insulin resistance. It is often associated with obesity, acanthosis nigricans, and an increased frequency of ketosis, and can have a variable clinical presentation, from slow and mild to severe.

----
[MONOGENIC DIABETES]
Monogenic diabetes is a rare form of diabetes caused by genetic defects in β-cell function or insulin action, and can have a variable clinical presentation, often incidental in some forms. It is distinct from type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with different underlying causes and characteristics.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
Gestational diabetes mellitus occurs in women during gestation, and is a distinct type of diabetes that requires proper diagnosis and management to prevent complications for both the mother and the fetus.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetes is associated with various complications, including macrovascular disease, impaired growth and development, and associated autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and celiac disease. Additionally, diabetes can lead to lipodystrophy, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and increased susceptibility to infections. These complications can have a significant impact on the quality of life of individuals with diabetes.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus involves screening for patients with risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and a family history of diabetes. Early intervention can potentially reduce future complication rates, and various approaches to diagnosis are available, including the use of Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) and Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) tests.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS]
Diagnostic tests for diabetes include random plasma tests, which do not require fasting, and fasting plasma glucose tests, which require an 8-hour fast. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher on a random plasma test may indicate diabetes, while a level of 126 mg/dl or higher on two or more fasting plasma glucose tests confirms a diabetes diagnosis.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends using Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) for diagnosis, while the World Health Organization (WHO) focuses on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). These tests help identify individuals with diabetes or pre-diabetes, allowing for early intervention and potential reduction in future complication rates.
----
[ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST]
The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted when the random plasma glucose test is 160-200 mg/dl and the fasting plasma test is 110-125 mg/dl. This test evaluates the body's response to glucose and requires fasting for at least 8 hours, but not more than 16 hours. A glucose level of 75 gm is given, and the blood is tested every 30 minutes to 1 hour for 2-3 hours. The test is normal if the glucose level at 2 hours is less than 140 mg/dl.

----
[GLYCATED PROTEINS]
Glycated proteins are formed when proteins react with glucose in the blood, and the extent of glycation is controlled by the concentration of glucose and the number of reactive amino groups in the protein. The concentration of glycated proteins in the blood is a marker for the fluctuation of blood glucose concentrations over a certain period. Glycated proteins with a longer lifetime in the blood are of interest, as they reflect the exposure of proteins to glucose for longer periods.

----
[GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN]
Glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) is a ketoamine compound formed by the combination of hemoglobin A and glucose, with a lifespan of 90-120 days. HbA1c is a retrospective indicator of the average glucose concentration and is recommended as an essential indicator for monitoring blood glucose control. A blood HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher is considered indicative of diabetes.

----
[DIABETES SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS]
The suggested approach to screening patients at risk for diabetes involves checking fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin every 2 years for normal individuals, and every 1-3 years for those with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGH). For patients with prediabetes, lifestyle changes are recommended, and for those with diabetes, treatment depends on the degree of hyperglycemia, with mild cases starting with lifestyle changes and/or metformin.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS]
For hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia but not critically ill, glycated hemoglobin should be measured. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, or newly diagnosed diabetes, should continue their outpatient regimen if glucose is well-controlled. Basal insulin doses may be started at 0.2-0.3 u/kg/day, with correction insulin for blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl.
----
[FRUCTOSAMINE TEST]
The fructosamine test measures glycated albumin, which serves as a marker to monitor blood glucose levels, providing a retrospective measure of average blood glucose concentration over a period of 1 to 3 weeks. The reference interval for glycated albumin is 205-285 micro mol/L. This test can be used to assess blood glucose control. Glycated albumin is formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and albumin in plasma.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is made if two or more of the plasma glucose values are met or exceeded. Women at high risk, such as those with a positive family history or marked obesity, should be screened as soon as feasible, and if the initial screening is negative, they should undergo retesting at 24-48 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test should be performed at least 6 weeks after pregnancy ends to reclassify the woman as having diabetes, normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose.

----
[GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND COMPLICATIONS]
The risk of complications of diabetes may differ according to the method of diagnosis, with preliminary data suggesting that glycated hemoglobin level may be a better predictor of certain complications, especially cardiovascular disease. Ongoing research is assessing the value of risk scores that incorporate glycemic measures, biomarkers, and risk factors to estimate diabetes risk. The method of diagnosis, whether by fasting plasma glucose testing or glycated hemoglobin testing, may impact the risk of complications.

----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE AND DIAGNOSIS]
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dl, and increased glycated hemoglobin (IGH) is defined as a glycated hemoglobin level of 5.7 to 6.4%. The diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed with a repeat test on a separate day or by an alternative test, and if the result is in the prediabetic range, the patient should be counseled or treated for pre-diabetes. If the result is entirely normal, rescreening in 6 months should be considered.

----
[GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT AND FOLLOW-UP]
Regular follow-up of diabetic patients with a healthcare provider is crucial in averting long-term complications. Strict metabolic control can delay or prevent the progression of complications associated with diabetes. Studies have reported the importance of controlling insulin resistance, which is often associated with obesity, and other risk factors such as family history and ethnicity. Regular follow-up and management can help individuals with diabetes manage their condition effectively.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Glycemic control is crucial in delaying the onset and slowing the progression of microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Additionally, glycemic control should be tailored to individual patient needs, considering factors such as psychosocial limitations and hypoglycemia unawareness. Effective glycemic control can prevent disability and promote rehabilitation in diabetic patients.

----
[GLYCEMIC GOALS AND INSULIN THERAPY]
Glycemic targets should be relaxed for patients with hypoglycemia unawareness, and insulin therapy is indicated for type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes with insulinopenia. Controlling blood glucose with insulin can be the most effective blood glucose-lowering therapy, and many patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require insulin therapy. Insulin requirements can exceed 1 unit/kg/day in patients with type 2 diabetes due to insulin resistance.

----
[DIABETES PREVALENCE AND FUTURE CHALLENGES]
The high prevalence of diabetes imposes a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and individuals, highlighting the need for preventive and curative measures. Lifestyle modification will play a key role in addressing the diabetes problem, and basic science research is essential for developing new prevention and treatment strategies. Implementing measures such as providing caloric content information on restaurant menus and reducing high-calorie food availability in school cafeterias can help mitigate the impact of diabetes.

----
[ROLE OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION]
Lifestyle modification is crucial in preventing and managing diabetes, and it will undoubtedly play a key role in the ultimate solution to the problem of diabetes. By promoting healthy lifestyle choices, individuals can reduce their risk of developing diabetes and its related complications. This can include measures such as healthy eating, regular physical activity, and weight management.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS]
The American Diabetes Association (2010) provides guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus, which includes Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The diagnosis of diabetes is based on plasma glucose levels, and the classification is important for determining the appropriate treatment. The guidelines also discuss the role of glycated hemoglobin (A1c) in the diagnosis of diabetes.

----
[DIABETES PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
The pathophysiology of diabetes involves the development of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, leading to hyperglycemia. The onset of Type 2 diabetes occurs at least 4-7 years before clinical diagnosis, and it is characterized by a gradual decline in insulin sensitivity and secretion. Understanding the pathophysiology of diabetes is essential for developing effective treatment strategies.

----
[DIABETES TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT]
The treatment of diabetes involves lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as well as pharmacological interventions, including insulin therapy and oral medications. Intensive blood glucose control has been shown to prevent the progression of diabetic microvascular complications, and it is recommended for patients with Type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (2012) provides standards of medical care in diabetes, which include guidelines for glucose monitoring, medication management, and lifestyle interventions.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS AND RISK FACTORS]
Diabetes is associated with several microvascular and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. The risk of complications can be reduced by intensive blood glucose control and lifestyle modifications. Several biomarkers, including glycated hemoglobin and serum biomarkers, have been identified as predictors of clinically incident diabetes and cardiovascular risk in nondiabetic adults.

----
[DIABETES CARE AND EDUCATION]
Improving chronic illness care requires a comprehensive approach that includes patient education, lifestyle interventions, and pharmacological management. The Indian experience has shown that improving psychosocial care can have a positive impact on diabetes management. Patient education and self-management are essential for achieving good glycemic control and preventing complications.
