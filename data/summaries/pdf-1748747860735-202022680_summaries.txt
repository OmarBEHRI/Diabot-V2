[INTRODUCTION TO DIABETES REPORT]
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a report on the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This report is the result of a WHO consultation and provides a comprehensive overview of diabetes diagnosis and classification. The report is divided into parts, with Part 1 focusing on the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus. It is published by the Department of Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance in Geneva.

----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION]
The report aims to provide a standardized approach to the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus, which is essential for effective management and treatment of the condition. The classification of diabetes is crucial for understanding the different types of diabetes and their corresponding treatment options. The report outlines the various criteria for diagnosing diabetes, including clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic methods. This information is vital for healthcare professionals and patients alike.

----
[WHO CONSULTATION OVERVIEW]
The WHO consultation brought together experts in the field of diabetes to discuss and agree upon the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus. The consultation resulted in a comprehensive report that provides a framework for understanding and managing diabetes. The report is intended for a global audience and aims to promote consistency in diabetes diagnosis and treatment worldwide. It is an essential resource for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers involved in diabetes care.
----
[DIABETES DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
Diabetes mellitus has specific definition and diagnostic criteria, which include diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, and individual diagnosis. The diagnosis of diabetes involves various factors, including fasting plasma/blood glucose concentrations. The diagnostic criteria have undergone changes, and epidemiological studies have played a role in shaping these criteria. 

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes has evolved over time, with earlier classifications being revised to reflect new understanding and application of the disease. The revised classification includes terminology and application of the new classification, which helps in better diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. 

----
[CLINICAL STAGING OF DIABETES]
The clinical staging of diabetes mellitus and other categories of glucose tolerance involves different stages, including diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose regulation, and normoglycaemia. Impaired glucose regulation includes impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia, while normoglycaemia refers to normal blood glucose levels. 

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Diabetes can be classified into different aetiological types, including Type 1, Type 2, and other specific types. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes have distinct characteristics, and other specific types of diabetes are also recognized, as listed in Table 3. 

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational hyperglycaemia and diabetes refer to high blood sugar levels during pregnancy, and the diagnosis of gestational diabetes is an important aspect of prenatal care. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves specific criteria and testing, as outlined in section 6.1.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further classified into autoimmune diabetes mellitus and idiopathic types. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly marked by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, infections, and uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus. These types of diabetes are less common but still significant in understanding the complexities of the disease. Each of these types has distinct causes and may require different management approaches.

----
[THE METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The metabolic syndrome is a condition related to diabetes, defined by a cluster of factors that increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The definition and future needs of the metabolic syndrome are important areas of study, as understanding this condition can help in the prevention and management of diabetes. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of the metabolic syndrome on diabetes care.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION HISTORY]
The classification and diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus were updated in the late 1970s by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Diabetes Data Group, bringing order to a previously chaotic situation. The WHO modified their criteria in 1985 to align with the NDDG values. Since then, more data and aetiological information have become available, prompting a re-examination of the issues. This led to the formation of expert groups, including one by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), to discuss and update the classification and criteria.

----
[UPDATE ON DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
In 1996 and 1997, the ADA and WHO convened expert groups to discuss and refine the classification and diagnostic criteria for diabetes. The groups reached similar conclusions, and their recommendations were published in reports. The WHO Consultation's provisional report solicited comments, which were considered in preparing the final report. The reports were prepared by Professors K.G.M.M. Alberti and P.Z. Zimmet on behalf of the Consultation members.

----
[REPORT PREPARATION AND FUNDING]
The WHO Consultation's report was made possible with financial support from several organizations, including Bayer (UK and Germany), Novo Nordisk (Denmark), and The Institute for Diabetes Discovery (USA). The report was prepared by Professors Alberti and Zimmet, with input from the Consultation members and comments from the provisional report. The final report aimed to update and refine the classification and diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus.
----
[DIABETES MELLITUS DEFINITION]
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia, resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both, and leading to disturbances in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. This condition can cause long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs. Diabetes mellitus may present with symptoms such as thirst, polyuria, blurring of vision, and weight loss, but often symptoms are not severe or may be absent. 

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
The long-term effects of diabetes mellitus include the development of specific complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, which can lead to blindness, renal failure, foot ulcers, amputation, and autonomic dysfunction. People with diabetes are also at increased risk of cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, and cerebrovascular disease. These complications can have a significant impact on the quality of life and life expectancy of individuals with diabetes. 

----
[DIABETES SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS]
Diabetes mellitus may present with characteristic symptoms, but often these symptoms are not severe or may be absent, allowing hyperglycaemia to cause pathological and functional changes for a long time before diagnosis. In its most severe forms, diabetes can lead to ketoacidosis or a non-ketotic hyperosmolar state, which can cause stupor, coma, and even death if left untreated. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial to prevent or delay the onset of complications.
----
[DIABETES PATHOGENESIS]
Several pathogenetic processes are involved in the development of diabetes, including the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency, and processes that result in resistance to insulin action. These abnormalities affect carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism due to deficient insulin action on target tissues. The lack of insulin or insensitivity to insulin leads to these metabolic abnormalities.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
A diagnosis of diabetes must be made with confidence, considering the lifelong consequences for the individual. The diagnostic criteria differ for individuals presenting with severe symptoms and hyperglycaemia versus those who are asymptomatic with slightly elevated blood glucose values. Severe hyperglycaemia under stress may be transitory and should not be considered diagnostic of diabetes on its own.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION]
For asymptomatic individuals, a single abnormal blood glucose value is not sufficient for a diagnosis of diabetes. At least one additional plasma or blood glucose test result in the diabetic range is necessary, either from a fasting sample, a random sample, or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If initial tests are inconclusive, periodic re-testing is advised to confirm the diagnosis.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS]
When deciding on a diagnostic or therapeutic course of action for diabetes, healthcare providers should consider additional factors such as ethnicity, family history, age, adiposity, and concomitant disorders. This comprehensive approach helps ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Glycated haemoglobin has been explored as an alternative to blood glucose estimation or the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for diagnosing diabetes.

----
[DIABETES IN CHILDREN]
Diabetes in children typically presents with severe symptoms, including very high blood glucose levels, marked glycosuria, and ketonuria. In most cases, the diagnosis is confirmed quickly through blood glucose measurements, and treatment, often including insulin injections, is initiated immediately. An OGTT is not necessary or appropriate for diagnosis in these circumstances, but may be used for children with less severe symptoms.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The clinical diagnosis of diabetes is often prompted by symptoms such as increased thirst and urine volume, recurrent infections, unexplained weight loss, and, in severe cases, drowsiness and coma. High levels of glycosuria are usually present, and a single blood glucose estimation in excess of a certain threshold can confirm the diagnosis. These diagnostic criteria help healthcare providers identify and manage diabetes effectively.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes can be established based on diagnostic values indicated in Figure 1, with levels of blood glucose below which a diagnosis of diabetes is unlikely in non-pregnant individuals. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) may be considered if casual blood glucose values are uncertain and fasting blood glucose levels are below diagnostic levels. The diagnostic criteria for children are the same as for adults.

----
[ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (OGTT) PROCEDURE]
For clinical purposes, an OGTT involves measuring blood glucose values while fasting and at 2 hours after a 75g oral glucose load for adults, and 1.75g per kg for children. This test helps establish diagnostic status when casual blood glucose values are uncertain.

----
[FASTING PLASMA/GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION CRITERIA]
The diagnostic value for fasting plasma glucose concentration has been lowered to 7.0 mmol/l-1 (126 mg/dl-1) and above, and for whole blood to 6.1 mmol/l-1 (110 mg/dl-1) and above. This change aims to represent a value equivalent in diagnostic significance to the 2-h post-load concentration.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC INTERPRETATIONS]
Diagnostic interpretations of fasting and 2-h post-load concentrations in non-pregnant subjects can be found in Table 1, which provides guidance on establishing a diagnosis of diabetes based on these values.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DIABETES]
The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been established through population-based studies, with a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) being considered an optimal cut-off point to separate the components of bimodal frequency distributions of fasting plasma glucose concentrations. This threshold is associated with an increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular disease. However, in certain populations, such as the elderly or those with less obesity, lower fasting glucose levels may be seen in individuals with 2-h post-load glucose values that are diagnostic for diabetes.

----
[EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF DIABETES]
Epidemiological studies of glucose intolerance and diabetes often classify individuals based on their blood glucose concentration measured after an overnight fast and/or 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose load. While 2-h values are often used for diagnostic screening, fasting plasma glucose alone may be used for epidemiological purposes if an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not possible. However, it has been shown that individuals identified by fasting values may differ from those identified by 2-h post-glucose challenge values, particularly in certain populations such as the elderly and those with less obesity.

----
[POPULATION VARIATIONS IN DIABETES DIAGNOSIS]
There are variations in diabetes diagnosis across different populations, with middle-aged, more obese individuals being more likely to be identified by fasting values, while the elderly and those with less obesity, such as many Asian populations, may be identified by 2-h post-glucose challenge values. These differences highlight the importance of considering population-specific factors when diagnosing and screening for diabetes.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DIABETES]
Patients are more likely to have diagnostic fasting values, and the overall population prevalence may or may not differ when estimates using fasting and 2-hour values are compared. The diagnosis of diabetes should not be based on a single glucose determination, but rather requires confirmatory symptoms or blood/plasma determination. This approach helps identify individuals at risk for developing complications, allowing for early preventive strategies.

----
[INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSIS REQUIREMENTS]
For individual diagnosis, both the 2-hour and fasting values should ideally be used to confirm the diagnosis. This approach contrasts with the recommendations of the ADA Expert Committee, which gives primacy to the fasting plasma glucose. Using both values helps ensure accurate diagnosis and allows for timely intervention to prevent complications. 

----
[COMPARISON WITH ADA GUIDELINES]
The ADA Expert Committee's guidelines differ from the recommended approach, as they prioritize the fasting plasma glucose for diagnosis. In contrast, using both the 2-hour and fasting values provides a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's glucose levels, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment.
----
[EARLY CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES]
The first widely accepted classification of diabetes mellitus was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980 and modified in 1985. This classification included clinical classes and statistical risk classes, with two major classes of diabetes mellitus: IDDM (Type 1) and NIDDM (Type 2). The 1985 classification also introduced a class of Malnutrition-related Diabetes Mellitus (MRDM) and included other classes such as Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION EVOLUTION]
The 1985 classification was widely accepted and used internationally, representing a compromise between clinical and aetiological classification. This classification allowed for the staging of diabetes mellitus based on clinical descriptive criteria and a complementary aetiological classification, even when the specific cause or aetiology was unknown. The classification was reflected in subsequent international disease nomenclatures, including the International Nomenclature of Diseases (IND) in 1991 and the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) in 1992.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus encompasses both clinical stages and aetiological types, reflecting the progression of the disease through several clinical stages regardless of its aetiology. This classification allows for categorization of individuals with diabetes according to clinical characteristics, even without information on the underlying aetiology. The clinical staging reflects the various degrees of hyperglycaemia in individual subjects with any of the disease processes that may lead to diabetes mellitus.

----
[CLINICAL STAGING]
The clinical staging of diabetes allows for categorization of all subjects with diabetes mellitus, regardless of the circumstances. The stage of glycaemia may change over time depending on the extent of the underlying disease processes. This staging reflects the fact that the disease process may be present but may not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycaemia.

----
[AETIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION]
The aetiological classification of diabetes reflects the improved understanding of the causes of diabetes mellitus. This classification results from the identification of the underlying defects or disease processes that lead to diabetes, allowing for a more accurate categorization of individuals with the disease. The aetiological classification is an important aspect of the revised classification of diabetes mellitus.
----
[EARLY DETECTION OF DIABETES]
The process leading to diabetes can be identified at any stage, even when blood sugar levels are normal. The presence of islet cell antibodies in a person with normal blood sugar levels can indicate the presence of the Type 1 autoimmune process. However, there are currently few specific indicators for the Type 2 process. 
----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND CONTROL]
Some individuals with diabetes can achieve adequate blood sugar control through weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral medications, and may not require insulin. In some cases, these individuals may even revert to impaired glucose tolerance or normal blood sugar levels. Others may require insulin for control, but can still survive without it due to some residual insulin secretion.
----
[INSULIN DEPENDENCY]
Individuals with extensive beta-cell destruction and no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can change over time, either improving with weight reduction or worsening with weight gain.
----
[DIABETES TERMINOLOGY]
The terms "insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" and "non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" along with their acronyms "IDDM" and "NIDDM" are no longer recommended for use due to confusion and misclassification of patients based on treatment rather than pathogenesis. Instead, the terms Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes should be used. This change aims to provide a clearer understanding of the different types of diabetes. 

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes encompasses cases primarily due to pancreatic islet beta-cell destruction and are prone to ketoacidosis, including those resulting from an autoimmune process and those with unknown aetiology or pathogenesis (idiopathic). This type does not include forms of beta-cell destruction or failure with specific known causes, such as cystic fibrosis or mitochondrial defects. Type 1 diabetes can sometimes be identified at earlier clinical stages than typical diabetes mellitus.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is the common major form of diabetes resulting from defects in insulin secretion, often combined with insulin resistance. A distinct lean phenotype of Type 2 diabetes found in adults in the Indian sub-continent may differ significantly from the more typical form of Type 2 diabetes found in other populations, suggesting variability within the Type 2 category. This highlights the complexity of diabetes classification and the need for precise terminology.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes has been revised, and the class "Malnutrition-related diabetes" (MRDM) has been deleted due to lack of convincing evidence that diabetes can be caused by malnutrition or protein deficiency. The former subtype of MRDM, Protein-deficient Pancreatic Diabetes (PDPD or PDDM), may be considered as a malnutrition-modulated form of diabetes mellitus. Further studies are needed to understand this condition.

----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
The class "Impaired Glucose Tolerance" is now classified as a stage of impaired glucose regulation, which can be observed in any hyperglycemic disorder and is not considered diabetes itself. This stage is a precursor to diabetes and requires monitoring and management to prevent progression to diabetes.

----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLYCAEMIA]
A clinical stage of Impaired Fasting Glycaemia has been introduced to classify individuals with fasting glucose values above the normal range but below those diagnostic of diabetes. This stage is important for early detection and intervention to prevent the development of diabetes.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Gestational Diabetes is a classification that now includes the groups formerly known as Gestational Impaired Glucose Tolerance (GIGT) and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). This change in classification aims to simplify and streamline the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The new classification encompasses a broader range of glucose tolerance impairments during pregnancy.

----
[IMPLICATIONS OF CLASSIFICATION CHANGE]
The revised classification of Gestational Diabetes may impact the way healthcare providers diagnose and manage the condition in pregnant women. It is essential to understand the new classification to provide accurate and effective care for women with gestational diabetes. This change may also influence patient education and treatment plans.
----
[DIABETES MELLITUS CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes mellitus is subdivided into three categories: insulin requiring for survival, insulin requiring for control, and not insulin requiring. The first category corresponds to the former clinical class of "Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus" and includes individuals who are C-peptide deficient. The latter two categories constitute the former class of Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM). Individuals with insulin requiring for control have some endogenous insulin secretion but require added exogenous insulin to achieve normoglycaemia.

----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE REGULATION]
Impaired glucose regulation refers to a metabolic state between normal glucose homeostasis and diabetes, and includes Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and Impaired Fasting Glycaemia (IFG). IGT and IFG represent different abnormalities of glucose regulation, one in the fasting state and one post-prandial, and are not interchangeable. This intermediate state is a precursor to diabetes and requires attention to prevent progression to diabetes.
----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a stage in the natural history of disordered carbohydrate metabolism, characterized by an increased risk of progressing to diabetes and macrovascular disease. IGT is often associated with the Metabolic Syndrome, also known as Insulin Resistance Syndrome. Individuals with IGT may have normal or near-normal glycated haemoglobin levels, indicating euglycaemia in daily life. IGT serves as an indicator or marker of enhanced risk for cardiovascular disease.

----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE]
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) refers to fasting glucose concentrations that are higher than the normal reference range but lower than those required to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The values for IFG are a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 6.1 mmol l–1 (110 mg dl–1) or greater, but less than 7.0 mmol l–1 (126 mg dl–1). Individuals with IFG have an increased risk of progressing to diabetes and macrovascular disease, although the risk of progression is lower than that of IGT. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is recommended to exclude the diagnosis of diabetes in individuals with IFG.

----
[RISK CATEGORIES FOR DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]
IGT and IFG are not clinical entities in their own right, but rather risk categories for future diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. They can occur as an intermediate stage in any of the disease processes, and individuals who meet criteria for IGT or IFG may be at enhanced risk for cardiovascular disease due to their correlation with other elements of the Metabolic Syndrome. Early detection and management of IGT and IFG are crucial to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
----
[GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) manifest glucose intolerance only when challenged with an oral glucose load, and this condition is a cardiovascular risk factor. A fasting venous plasma glucose concentration of less than 6.1 mmol l–1 (110 mg dl–1) is considered "normal". This value is observed in people with proven normal glucose tolerance, although some may have IGT if an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is performed. Values above this threshold are associated with a greater risk of developing micro- and macrovascular complications.

----
[NORMOGLYCAEMIA CLASSIFICATION]
Normoglycaemia is classified as a fasting venous plasma glucose concentration of less than 6.1 mmol l–1 (110 mg dl–1), which is considered "normal" and is observed in people with proven normal glucose tolerance. This classification includes a stage of normoglycaemia where individuals who have evidence of pathological processes that may lead to diabetes mellitus, or in whom a reversal of hyperglycaemia has occurred, are also classified. The recognition of pathological processes at an early stage may be useful in preventing progression to more advanced stages of diabetes.

----
[EARLY RECOGNITION AND PREVENTION]
The pathological processes that lead to diabetes mellitus can begin and be recognizable in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Early recognition of these processes may be useful in preventing progression to more advanced stages of diabetes. Effective treatments or the natural history of some forms of diabetes mellitus may also result in reversion of hyperglycaemia to a state of normoglycaemia, highlighting the importance of early intervention and management.
----
[DIABETES TYPE 1 CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the destruction of beta-cells, which can be detected before the disease is clinically manifest. This process is often autoimmune in nature, with the presence of anti-GAD, islet cell, or insulin antibodies. However, in some cases, particularly in non-Caucasians, no evidence of an autoimmune disorder may be found, and these cases are classified as "Type 1 idiopathic". The aetiological Type 1 process can be identified and sub-categorized with appropriate antibody determinations.

----
[DIABETES TYPE 1 DIAGNOSIS]
The diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes involves detecting the process of beta-cell destruction, which may require specialized measurements such as antibody determinations. These measurements may not be widely available, but if performed, can help classify individual patients and guide treatment. The presence of antibodies can indicate an autoimmune process, while their absence may suggest an idiopathic form of the disease. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment of Type 1 diabetes.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and is characterized by disorders of insulin action and insulin secretion. Both insulin action and secretion disorders are usually present when Type 2 diabetes is clinically manifest. The specific reasons for the development of these abnormalities are not yet known.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes are less common causes of diabetes mellitus, but can be identified by a specific underlying defect or disease process. These types include fibrocalculous pancreatopathy, a form of diabetes formerly classified as malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus. They are distinct from Type 2 diabetes due to their identifiable underlying causes.
----
[DEFINITION OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational diabetes is a condition characterized by carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycemia, with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. It may have been previously unrecognized, and its definition applies regardless of whether insulin is used for treatment or if the condition persists after pregnancy. This condition is distinct from pre-existing diabetes mellitus in pregnant women.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES VS PRE-EXISTING DIABETES]
Women who are known to have diabetes mellitus before becoming pregnant do not have gestational diabetes, but rather "diabetes mellitus and pregnancy", requiring specialized treatment before, during, and after pregnancy. This distinction is crucial for proper management and care.

----
[GLUCOSE LEVELS IN EARLY PREGNANCY]
In the early stages of pregnancy, fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations are normally lower than in non-pregnant women. Elevated glucose levels during this time may indicate pre-existing diabetes, but specific criteria for designating abnormal glucose concentrations have not been established, necessitating careful management and potential further testing, such as an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES RISK FACTORS]
Individuals at high risk for gestational diabetes include older women, those with a previous history of glucose intolerance, those with a history of large for gestational age babies, and women from certain high-risk ethnic groups. Pregnant women with elevated fasting or casual blood glucose levels are also at high risk. Screening for gestational diabetes may be necessary during the first trimester for high-risk populations. This allows for early detection of previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
To diagnose gestational diabetes, a standard Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is performed after overnight fasting, involving 75g of anhydrous glucose in water. Plasma glucose is measured fasting and after 2 hours, and women who meet WHO criteria for diabetes mellitus or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) are classified as having Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). A 75g OGTT is also used to re-classify women after pregnancy, determining if they have diabetes mellitus, IGT, or normal glucose tolerance.

----
[POST-PREGNANCY FOLLOW-UP]
After pregnancy, women who had gestational diabetes should undergo a 75g OGTT six weeks or more after delivery to determine their glucose tolerance status. Regardless of the result, these women are at increased risk of developing diabetes later in life. The significance of Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) in pregnancy is still being researched, but women with IFG should undergo a 75g OGTT for further evaluation.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that results from the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This form of diabetes was previously referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, Type 1 diabetes, or juvenile-onset diabetes. The rate of beta cell destruction can vary, with some individuals experiencing rapid destruction and others experiencing slow destruction.

----
[INSULIN DEPENDENCY]
Patients with any form of diabetes may require insulin treatment at some stage of their disease, regardless of the underlying aetiological class. The use of insulin does not define the type of diabetes, and individuals with Type 1 diabetes often become dependent on insulin for survival eventually. They are also at risk for ketoacidosis, particularly if they have limited residual beta-cell function.

----
[AUTOIMMUNE DIABETES MELLITUS]
Autoimmune Diabetes Mellitus, also known as Type 1 diabetes, can present in different ways, including rapid progression to ketoacidosis, modest fasting hyperglycaemia that can rapidly worsen, or slow progression with retained residual beta-cell function. The presentation can vary depending on factors such as age, with children and adolescents more likely to present with ketoacidosis, and adults more likely to experience slow progression.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by little or no insulin secretion, resulting in low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide. Markers of immune destruction, such as islet cell autoantibodies and autoantibodies to insulin, are present in 85-90% of individuals with Type 1 diabetes. The peak incidence of this form of diabetes occurs in childhood and adolescence, but can occur at any age. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors contribute to the autoimmune destruction of beta cells.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS]
Patients with Type 1 diabetes may also have other autoimmune disorders, such as Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and Addison's disease. Although obesity is not typically present at diagnosis, it is not incompatible with the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. These associated conditions highlight the importance of comprehensive care and monitoring for individuals with Type 1 diabetes.

----
[IDIOPATHIC TYPE 1 DIABETES]
There are forms of Type 1 diabetes with no known etiology, characterized by permanent insulinopenia and prone to ketoacidosis, but without evidence of autoimmunity. This form of diabetes is more common among individuals of African and Asian origin, and may have varying requirements for insulin replacement therapy, with some patients periodically developing ketoacidosis.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by predominantly insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency, or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. This form of diabetes was previously known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes. Individuals with Type 2 diabetes often have relative insulin deficiency and are resistant to the action of insulin. They may not need insulin treatment to survive, at least initially.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND COMPLICATIONS]
Type 2 diabetes is frequently undiagnosed for many years due to mild hyperglycemia that may not provoke noticeable symptoms. However, individuals with this form of diabetes are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications. The disease may remain undiagnosed until complications arise, highlighting the importance of early detection and management.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS]
The specific causes of Type 2 diabetes are not known, but it is likely that multiple mechanisms are involved. Obesity is a major risk factor, as it causes or aggravates insulin resistance, and the majority of patients with Type 2 diabetes are obese. Even non-obese individuals may have an increased percentage of body fat, particularly in the abdominal region, which can contribute to insulin resistance.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CLASSIFICATION AND DIFFERENTIATION]
Type 2 diabetes is a term used to describe individuals who do not have autoimmune destruction of the pancreas or other known specific causes of diabetes. As research progresses and specific pathogenetic processes and genetic defects are identified, the classification of Type 2 diabetes may become more definitive, and some cases may be reclassified into "Other types" of diabetes.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by defective and insufficient insulin secretion, which cannot compensate for insulin resistance. Despite appearing to have normal or elevated insulin levels, patients with Type 2 diabetes have high blood glucose levels, indicating impaired insulin function. Insulin sensitivity can be increased through weight reduction, physical activity, and pharmacological treatment, but not restored to normal. 

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK FACTORS]
The risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity. It also occurs more frequently in women with prior gestational diabetes, individuals with hypertension or dyslipidaemia, and certain racial/ethnic subgroups. Additionally, there is a strong familial and likely genetic predisposition to Type 2 diabetes, although the genetics are complex and not clearly defined.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES]
Some patients presenting with Type 2 diabetes may have autoantibodies similar to those found in Type 1 diabetes, making diagnosis challenging if antibody determinations are not made. Non-obese patients or those with relatives with Type 1 diabetes, particularly of Northern European origin, may be suspected of having late-onset Type 1 diabetes, highlighting the need for careful diagnostic evaluation.
