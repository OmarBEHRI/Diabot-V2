[INTRODUCTION TO DIABETES REPORT]
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a report on the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This report is the result of a WHO consultation and provides a comprehensive overview of diabetes diagnosis and classification. The report is divided into parts, with the first part focusing on diagnosis and classification. It is published by the Department of Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance in Geneva.

----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION]
The report provides a framework for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus, which is essential for healthcare professionals to accurately identify and manage the condition. The classification of diabetes is crucial for determining the best course of treatment and for predicting potential complications. The report aims to standardize the diagnosis and classification of diabetes worldwide. This will help improve diabetes care and treatment outcomes globally.

----
[WHO CONSULTATION OBJECTIVES]
The WHO consultation aimed to review current knowledge on diabetes diagnosis and classification and to provide recommendations for healthcare professionals. The consultation brought together experts in the field to discuss and agree on a standardized approach to diabetes diagnosis and classification. The report resulting from this consultation provides a consensus on the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus. This consensus will help guide healthcare professionals in their practice.

[DIABETES DEFINITION]
Diabetes mellitus is a condition characterized by glucose intolerance, with diagnostic criteria including specific plasma or blood glucose concentrations. The definition of diabetes has been refined over time to reflect a better understanding of the condition. Diagnosis and diagnostic criteria are crucial for identifying and managing diabetes effectively. 

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The diagnostic criteria for diabetes include changes in fasting plasma or blood glucose concentrations, with specific values used to diagnose the condition. Epidemiological studies have informed the development of these criteria, which are applied to individual diagnoses. The criteria are used to distinguish between different categories of glucose intolerance.

----
[CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES]
Diabetes can be classified into different types, with earlier classifications having been revised over time. The revised classification system includes application of new criteria and terminology, as outlined in Table 2. This classification system helps to guide diagnosis, treatment, and management of the condition.

----
[CLINICAL STAGING]
The clinical staging of diabetes mellitus and other categories of glucose tolerance involves categorizing individuals into different stages, including diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose regulation, and normoglycaemia. This staging system is illustrated in Figure 2 and helps to inform treatment and management decisions.

----
[TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 1 diabetes is a specific aetiological type of diabetes, characterized by an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Type 2 diabetes is another major type, accounting for the majority of cases, and is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Other specific types of diabetes are also recognized, as outlined in Table 3.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational hyperglycaemia and diabetes are conditions that occur during pregnancy, with diagnosis typically occurring between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is critical for managing the condition and preventing adverse outcomes for both mother and baby.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further classified into autoimmune diabetes mellitus and idiopathic types. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly marked by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, infections, and uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus. These types of diabetes are less common but still important to recognize and manage appropriately. Genetic syndromes sometimes associated with diabetes are also considered under this category.

----
[THE METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The metabolic syndrome is a condition related to diabetes, but its definition and future needs are still being studied and refined. The metabolic syndrome is discussed in more detail in section 8 of the textbook, which includes its definition and future needs. Understanding the metabolic syndrome is important for comprehensive diabetes care and management.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS]
The oral glucose tolerance test is a diagnostic tool used to assess glucose metabolism and diagnose diabetes, and its methods are outlined in Annex 1 of the textbook. Additionally, Annex 2 provides information on methods for measuring substances in blood and urine, which is essential for monitoring and managing diabetes. These diagnostic tests play a crucial role in diabetes care and education.
