[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further classified into autoimmune diabetes mellitus and idiopathic types. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly marked by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, infections, and uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus. These types of diabetes are less common but still important to recognize and manage appropriately. Genetic syndromes sometimes associated with diabetes are also included in this category.

----
[THE METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The metabolic syndrome is a condition related to diabetes, but its definition and future needs are still being studied and refined. The metabolic syndrome is likely to be an important consideration in the management and prevention of diabetes, and further research is needed to fully understand its role. 

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS]
The oral glucose tolerance test is a diagnostic tool used to assess glucose metabolism and diagnose diabetes, and methods for measuring substances in blood and urine are also important for diabetes diagnosis and management. These tests can help healthcare providers diagnose and monitor diabetes, and make informed treatment decisions.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION HISTORY]
The classification and diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus were updated in the late 1970s by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Diabetes Data Group. These updates brought order to a previously chaotic situation with varying nomenclature and diagnostic criteria. The WHO slightly modified their criteria in 1985 to align with the National Diabetes Data Group values. This laid the groundwork for further updates and refinements in the field of diabetes diagnosis and classification.

----
[UPDATE ON DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
In 1997, an American Diabetes Association (ADA) expert group published recommendations on updating the classification and diagnostic criteria for diabetes. Similarly, the WHO convened a consultation in 1996, which reached similar conclusions to the ADA group. The reports from these groups were prepared by experts in the field, including Professor K.G.M.M. Alberti and Professor P.Z. Zimmet, and were supported by various organizations, including Bayer and Novo Nordisk.

----
[DEFINITION OF METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The WHO consultation also aimed to include a definition of the "Metabolic Syndrome" as part of the updated classification and diagnostic criteria for diabetes. This definition is an important aspect of understanding the broader context of diabetes and its related conditions. The inclusion of the Metabolic Syndrome definition reflects the growing recognition of the complex inter relationships between diabetes and other metabolic disorders.
----
[DIABETES DEFINITION]
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia and disturbances in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. This condition can lead to long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs. The effects of diabetes mellitus can be severe, including ketoacidosis, non-ketotic hyperosmolar state, and even death if left untreated.

----
[DIABETES SYMPTOMS]
The symptoms of diabetes mellitus may include thirst, polyuria, blurring of vision, and weight loss, although in some cases, symptoms may be absent or mild, leading to a delayed diagnosis. If left undiagnosed, hyperglycaemia can cause pathological and functional changes, which can progress over time.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
The long-term effects of diabetes mellitus include the development of specific complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, which can lead to blindness, renal failure, foot ulcers, and amputation. Additionally, people with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, and cerebrovascular disease, as well as autonomic dysfunction, including sexual dysfunction.
----
[DIABETES PATHOGENESIS]
Several pathogenetic processes are involved in the development of diabetes, including those that destroy the beta cells of the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency, and those that result in resistance to insulin action. This leads to abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism due to deficient insulin action on target tissues. The consequences of these processes are a lack of insulin or insensitivity to insulin.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
A diagnosis of diabetes must be made with confidence, as the consequences for the individual are considerable and lifelong. The diagnosis should not be made based on a single abnormal blood glucose value, especially in asymptomatic individuals. For asymptomatic people, at least one additional plasma or blood glucose test result is essential to confirm the diagnosis, either through fasting, a random sample, or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION]
Severe hyperglycaemia detected under stress may be transitory and should not be regarded as diagnostic of diabetes. In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, it is advisable to maintain surveillance with periodic re-testing until the diagnostic situation becomes clear. This approach helps ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of diabetes.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS]
When deciding on a diagnostic or therapeutic course of action for diabetes, healthcare providers should consider additional factors such as ethnicity, family history, age, adiposity, and concomitant disorders. These factors can help inform the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Glycated haemoglobin has been explored as an alternative to blood glucose estimation or the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for diagnosing diabetes.

----
[DIABETES IN CHILDREN]
Diabetes in children typically presents with severe symptoms, including very high blood glucose levels, marked glycosuria, and ketonuria, and is often confirmed through blood glucose measurements. In these cases, treatment, including insulin injection, is usually initiated immediately as a life-saving measure. An OGTT is not necessary or appropriate for diagnosis in children with severe symptoms.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The clinical diagnosis of diabetes is often prompted by symptoms such as increased thirst and urine volume, recurrent infections, unexplained weight loss, and, in severe cases, drowsiness and coma. High levels of glycosuria are usually present, and a single blood glucose estimation in excess of a certain threshold can be used to diagnose diabetes. These symptoms and test results can help healthcare providers diagnose and manage diabetes effectively.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes can be established based on diagnostic values indicated in Figure 1, with levels of blood glucose below which a diagnosis of diabetes is unlikely in non-pregnant individuals. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is only necessary if casual blood glucose values are uncertain and fasting blood glucose levels are below diagnostic levels. The diagnostic criteria for children are the same as for adults. 
----
[ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (OGTT) PROCEDURE]
For clinical purposes, an OGTT involves measuring blood glucose values while fasting and at 2 hours after a 75g oral glucose load for adults, and 1.75g per kg for children. This test is used to establish diagnostic status when casual blood glucose values are uncertain.
----
[FASTING PLASMA/GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION CRITERIA]
The diagnostic value for fasting plasma glucose concentration has been lowered to 7.0 mmol l-1 (126 mg dl-1) and above, and for whole blood to 6.1 mmol l-1 (110 mg dl-1) and above. This change aims to represent a value equivalent in diagnostic significance to the 2-h post-load concentration.
----
[COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC VALUES]
The new fasting criterion is chosen to correspond in diagnostic significance to the 2-h post-load concentration, which remains unchanged. This equivalence is used to determine the diagnostic value of fasting plasma glucose concentrations.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DIABETES]
The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been established through population-based studies, with a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) being considered an optimal cut-off point to separate the components of bimodal frequency distributions of fasting plasma glucose concentrations. This cut-off point is associated with an increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular disease. However, in certain populations, such as the elderly or less obese individuals, lower fasting glucose levels may be seen in persons who have 2-hour post-load glucose values that are diagnostic for diabetes.

----
[EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF DIABETES]
Epidemiological studies of glucose intolerance and diabetes often classify individuals based on their blood glucose concentration measured after an overnight fast and/or 2 hours after a 75g oral glucose load. While 2-hour values are often used for diagnostic screening, fasting plasma glucose alone may be used for epidemiological purposes if an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not possible. However, it has been shown that individuals identified by fasting values may differ from those identified by 2-hour post-glucose challenge values, particularly in certain populations such as the elderly and those with less obesity.

----
[POPULATION VARIATIONS IN DIABETES DIAGNOSIS]
There are variations in diabetes diagnosis across different populations, with middle-aged, more obese individuals being more likely to be identified by fasting values, while the elderly and less obese individuals, such as many Asian populations, may be identified by 2-hour post-glucose challenge values. These differences highlight the importance of considering population-specific factors when diagnosing and screening for diabetes.
----
[DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
The diagnosis of diabetes should not be based on a single glucose determination, but rather requires confirmatory symptoms or blood/plasma determination. Both the 2-hour and fasting values should be used to identify individuals at risk for developing complications. This approach allows for early preventive strategies to be implemented. 

----
[COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC METHODS]
The use of fasting and 2-hour glucose values may yield different estimates of population prevalence, with some studies finding a difference and others finding no difference. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Expert Committee recommends using the fasting plasma glucose as the primary diagnostic criterion. 
----
[INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSIS REQUIREMENTS]
Individual diagnosis of diabetes requires the identification of people at risk for developing complications, in whom early preventive strategies are indicated. A confirmatory diagnosis should be made using a combination of symptoms and blood/plasma glucose determinations, rather than a single glucose test.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION HISTORY]
The first widely accepted classification of diabetes mellitus was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980, with a modified version released in 1985. These classifications included clinical classes and statistical risk classes, and introduced terms such as IDDM (Type 1) and NIDDM (Type 2). The 1985 classification also introduced a class of Malnutrition-related Diabetes Mellitus (MRDM) and retained other classes such as Other Types, Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT), and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). This classification was widely accepted and is used internationally.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM]
The 1985 classification system represented a compromise between clinical and aetiological classification, allowing for the classification of individual subjects and patients in a clinically useful manner even when the specific cause or aetiology was unknown. The system includes both staging of diabetes mellitus based on clinical descriptive criteria and a complementary aetiological classification. This classification system has been reflected in subsequent international disease nomenclatures, including the International Nomenclature of Diseases (IND) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The system provides a framework for understanding and managing diabetes mellitus.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus encompasses both clinical stages and aetiological types, as suggested by Kuzuya and Matsuda. This classification reflects the progression of diabetes through several clinical stages, regardless of its aetiology. Individual subjects may move from stage to stage in either direction, and can be categorized by stage according to clinical characteristics.

----
[CLINICAL STAGING OF DIABETES]
The clinical staging of diabetes reflects the various degrees of hyperglycaemia in individual subjects, and all subjects with diabetes mellitus can be categorized according to clinical stage. The stage of glycaemia may change over time depending on the extent of the underlying disease processes. This classification is achievable in all circumstances, allowing for accurate categorization of diabetes patients.

----
[AETIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION]
The aetiological classification of diabetes reflects the underlying causes of the disease, and is based on improved understanding of the causes of diabetes mellitus. This classification takes into account the fact that the defect or disease process may be present but not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycaemia. The aetiological classification provides a more comprehensive understanding of the disease, allowing for more targeted treatment and management.
----
[EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF DIABETES]
The process leading to diabetes can be identified at any stage, even when blood sugar levels are normal. The presence of islet cell antibodies in a person with normal blood sugar levels can indicate the presence of the Type 1 autoimmune process. However, there are currently few specific indicators for the Type 2 process. 
----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND CONTROL]
The same disease processes that cause diabetes can also lead to impaired fasting glycaemia and/or impaired glucose tolerance. Some individuals with diabetes can achieve adequate blood sugar control through weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral medications, and may not require insulin. 
----
[INSULIN REQUIREMENT AND SURVIVAL]
Individuals with diabetes who have some residual insulin secretion can survive without insulin, but may still require it for adequate blood sugar control. Those with extensive beta-cell destruction and no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. 
----
[DISEASE PROGRESSION AND REGRESSION]
The severity of the metabolic abnormality in diabetes can regress, progress, or remain stable, depending on factors such as weight reduction or gain.
----
[DIABETES TERMINOLOGY]
The terms "insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" and "non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" and their acronyms "IDDM" and "NIDDM" are no longer recommended for use, as they can be confusing and lead to misclassification of patients. Instead, the terms Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes should be used. This change in terminology aims to classify diabetes based on its pathogenesis rather than treatment.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic islet beta-cell destruction and a tendency to develop ketoacidosis. This type includes cases resulting from an autoimmune process, as well as those with unknown aetiology or pathogenesis (idiopathic). However, it excludes forms of beta-cell destruction or failure with specific known causes, such as cystic fibrosis or mitochondrial defects.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, resulting from defects in insulin secretion and often accompanied by insulin resistance. A distinct lean phenotype of Type 2 diabetes has been identified in adults from the Indian subcontinent, which may differ from the more typical form of Type 2 diabetes found in other populations. This highlights the importance of considering the heterogeneity of Type 2 diabetes in diagnosis and treatment.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes has been revised, and the class "Malnutrition-related diabetes" (MRDM) has been deleted due to lack of evidence that diabetes can be caused by malnutrition or protein deficiency. The former subtype of MRDM, Protein-deficient Pancreatic Diabetes (PDPD or PDDM), is considered a malnutrition-modulated form of diabetes mellitus. More studies are needed to understand this condition.

----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
The class "Impaired Glucose Tolerance" is now classified as a stage of impaired glucose regulation, which can be observed in any hyperglycemic disorder and is not considered diabetes itself. This stage is a precursor to diabetes and indicates an increased risk of developing the condition.

----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLYCAEMIA]
A new clinical stage, Impaired Fasting Glycaemia, has been introduced to classify individuals with fasting glucose values above the normal range but below those diagnostic of diabetes. This stage helps identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes and allows for early intervention.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Gestational Diabetes is a classification that now includes the groups formerly known as Gestational Impaired Glucose Tolerance (GIGT) and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). This change in classification aims to simplify the diagnosis and treatment of gestational diabetes. The new classification encompasses all cases of glucose intolerance that are first detected during pregnancy.

---- 
[IMPLICATIONS OF CLASSIFICATION CHANGE]
The revised classification of Gestational Diabetes has implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of the condition. It is essential to understand the new classification to provide appropriate care and education to patients with gestational diabetes. This change may also impact the way healthcare providers approach glucose screening and diagnosis during pregnancy.
----
[DIABETES MELLITUS CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes mellitus is subdivided into three categories: insulin requiring for survival, insulin requiring for control, and not insulin requiring. The first category corresponds to the former clinical class of "Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus" and includes individuals who are C-peptide deficient. The latter two categories constitute the former class of Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM). These categories help determine the appropriate treatment approach for individuals with diabetes.

----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE REGULATION]
Impaired glucose regulation refers to a metabolic state between normal glucose homeostasis and diabetes, characterized by Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and Impaired Fasting Glycaemia (IFG). IGT and IFG represent different abnormalities of glucose regulation, one in the fasting state and one post-prandial, and are not interchangeable. Recognizing impaired glucose regulation is important for early intervention and prevention of diabetes.
----
[IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE]
Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is a stage in the natural history of disordered carbohydrate metabolism, characterized by an increased risk of progressing to diabetes and macrovascular disease. IGT is often associated with the Metabolic Syndrome, also known as Insulin Resistance Syndrome. Individuals with IGT may have normal or near-normal glycated haemoglobin levels, but are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is recommended to exclude the diagnosis of diabetes in individuals with IGT.

----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE]
Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) refers to fasting glucose concentrations that are higher than the normal reference range, but lower than those required to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The values for IFG are a fasting plasma glucose concentration of  mmol/l–1 (110 mg/dl–1) or greater, but less than  mmol/l–1 (126 mg/dl–1). IFG is a risk category for future diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease, and individuals with IFG may have a similar CVD risk factor profile to those with IGT.

----
[RISK CATEGORIES FOR DIABETES]
IGT and IFG are not clinical entities in their own right, but rather risk categories for future diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. They can occur as an intermediate stage in any of the disease processes, and individuals who meet criteria for IGT or IFG may be euglycaemic in their daily lives. It is recommended that all those with IFG have an OGTT to exclude the diagnosis of diabetes, if resources allow. Early detection and management of IGT and IFG can help prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
----
[DEFINING NORMOGLYCAEMIA]
A fasting venous plasma glucose concentration of less than 6.1 mmol l–1 (110 mg dl–1) is considered "normal" and is observed in people with proven normal glucose tolerance. However, some individuals with normal glucose tolerance may still have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) if an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is performed. Values above this threshold are associated with a greater risk of developing micro- and macrovascular complications.

----
[EARLY RECOGNITION AND PREVENTION]
The pathological processes that lead to diabetes mellitus can begin and be recognizable in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Recognizing these processes at an early stage may be useful in preventing progression to more advanced stages of diabetes. Effective treatments or the natural history of some forms of diabetes may also result in reversion of hyperglycaemia to a state of normoglycaemia.

----
[CLASSIFICATION OF NORMOGLYCAEMIA]
A proposed classification includes a stage of normoglycaemia where individuals with evidence of pathological processes that may lead to diabetes mellitus, or those who have experienced a reversal of hyperglycaemia, are classified. This classification aims to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes and those who have successfully reversed their hyperglycaemia.
----
[DIABETES TYPE 1 DEFINITION]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the destruction of beta-cells, which can lead to diabetes mellitus and requires insulin for survival to prevent ketoacidosis, coma, and death. This type of diabetes is often associated with the presence of anti-GAD, islet cell, or insulin antibodies, indicating an autoimmune process. However, in some cases, particularly in non-Caucasians, no evidence of an autoimmune disorder may be found, and these cases are classified as "Type 1 idiopathic". The aetiological classification of Type 1 diabetes can be identified and sub-categorized with appropriate antibody determinations.

----
[DIABETES TYPE 1 DIAGNOSIS]
The diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes involves detecting the process of beta-cell destruction, which can be done through antibody determinations, such as anti-GAD, islet cell, or insulin antibodies. These measurements can help identify the autoimmune processes leading to beta-cell destruction and may be available in certain centers. If these measurements are performed, the classification of individual patients should reflect the results, allowing for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, characterized by disorders of insulin action and insulin secretion. Both of these disorders are usually present when Type 2 diabetes is clinically manifest. The specific reasons for the development of these abnormalities are not yet known.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes are less common causes of diabetes mellitus, but can be identified by a specific underlying defect or disease process. These types include fibrocalculous pancreatopathy, a form of diabetes formerly classified as malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus. They are distinct from Type 2 diabetes due to their identifiable underlying causes.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES DEFINITION]
Gestational diabetes is a condition characterized by carbohydrate intolerance and hyperglycemia that is first recognized during pregnancy, regardless of whether insulin is used for treatment or if the condition persists after pregnancy. This definition applies even if the glucose intolerance may have existed before pregnancy but was previously unrecognized. Women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus are not considered to have gestational diabetes, but rather "diabetes mellitus and pregnancy". 

----
[GLUCOSE LEVELS DURING PREGNANCY]
In the early stages of pregnancy, fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations are normally lower than in non-pregnant women. Elevated glucose levels during this time may indicate pre-existing diabetes, but specific criteria for designating abnormally high glucose concentrations have not been established. Careful management is necessary if higher-than-usual plasma glucose levels are detected, and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) may be recommended. 

----
[EARLY PREGNANCY GLUCOSE MANAGEMENT]
The occurrence of higher-than-usual plasma glucose levels in early pregnancy requires careful management and may indicate the need for an OGTT. Normal glucose tolerance in the early part of pregnancy is important, and any deviations from normal glucose levels should be carefully monitored and addressed to ensure the best possible outcomes for both the mother and the fetus.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES RISK FACTORS]
Individuals at high risk for gestational diabetes include older women, those with a previous history of glucose intolerance, those with a history of large for gestational age babies, and women from certain high-risk ethnic groups. Pregnant women with elevated fasting or casual blood glucose levels are also at high risk. Screening for gestational diabetes may be appropriate during the first trimester for high-risk populations. 

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
To diagnose gestational diabetes, a standard Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is performed after overnight fasting, involving 75g of anhydrous glucose in water. Plasma glucose is measured fasting and after 2 hours, and pregnant women who meet WHO criteria for diabetes mellitus or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) are classified as having Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). 

----
[POST-PREGNANCY CLASSIFICATION AND RISK]
After pregnancy, women with gestational diabetes should be re-classified as having diabetes mellitus, IGT, or normal glucose tolerance based on a 75g OGTT six weeks or more after delivery. Regardless of the post-pregnancy result, these women are at increased risk of subsequently developing diabetes. The significance of Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) in pregnancy remains to be established, but women with IFG should undergo a 75g OGTT.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterized by the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This form of diabetes was previously referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, Type 1 diabetes, or juvenile-onset diabetes. The rate of beta cell destruction can vary, with some individuals experiencing rapid destruction and others experiencing slow destruction. 

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES SUBTYPES]
Autoimmune Diabetes Mellitus, also known as Type 1 diabetes, can be further categorized into subtypes, including rapidly progressive and slowly progressive forms. The rapidly progressive form is commonly observed in children, while the slowly progressive form, also known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), generally occurs in adults. 

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES SYMPTOMS]
The symptoms of Type 1 diabetes can vary, with some patients presenting with ketoacidosis as the first manifestation of the disease, while others may experience modest fasting hyperglycaemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycaemia and/or ketoacidosis in the presence of infection or other stress. Additionally, some adults with Type 1 diabetes may retain residual beta-cell function for many years, preventing ketoacidosis. 

----
[INSULIN DEPENDENCY IN TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Individuals with Type 1 diabetes often become dependent on insulin for survival and are at risk for ketoacidosis, particularly if they do not receive adequate insulin treatment. As the disease progresses, patients with Type 1 diabetes may require insulin treatment to manage their condition and prevent complications.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by little or no insulin secretion, low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide, and the presence of immune destruction markers such as islet cell autoantibodies. These markers are present in 85-90% of individuals with Type 1 diabetes when fasting diabetic hyperglycaemia is initially detected. The peak incidence of Type 1 diabetes occurs in childhood and adolescence, but onset can occur at any age. There is a genetic predisposition to autoimmune destruction of beta cells, which is also influenced by environmental factors.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES]
Patients with Type 1 diabetes are usually not obese at presentation, but obesity is not incompatible with the diagnosis. They may also have other autoimmune disorders, such as Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and Addison's disease. The presence of these comorbidities can impact the diagnosis and management of Type 1 diabetes. 

----
[IDIOPATHIC TYPE 1 DIABETES]
There are forms of Type 1 diabetes with no known etiology, characterized by permanent insulinopenia and a predisposition to ketoacidosis, but without evidence of autoimmunity. This form of diabetes is more common among individuals of African and Asian origin, and can manifest differently, such as with periodic requirements for insulin replacement therapy and ketoacidosis.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, rather than an absolute deficiency. Individuals with this type of diabetes often do not require insulin treatment to survive, at least initially. This form of diabetes can go undiagnosed for many years due to mild hyperglycemia that may not provoke noticeable symptoms.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS]
People with Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications, despite the fact that the hyperglycemia may not be severe enough to cause noticeable symptoms. The risk of these complications highlights the importance of proper diagnosis and management of the condition.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES ETIOLOGY AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS]
The specific causes of Type 2 diabetes are not yet fully understood, but it is known that autoimmune destruction of the pancreas does not occur. Obesity is a major factor, as it can cause or aggravate insulin resistance, and many patients with Type 2 diabetes are obese or have a high percentage of body fat distributed in the abdominal region.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS]
Type 2 diabetes may be reclassified in the future as specific pathogenetic processes and genetic defects are identified, allowing for more definitive diagnosis and differentiation from other types of diabetes. Currently, diagnosis is based on the presence of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, rather than other specific causes of diabetes.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by defective and insufficient insulin secretion, despite often having normal or elevated insulin levels, and is associated with insulin resistance. The condition can be managed through weight reduction, increased physical activity, and pharmacological treatment of hyperglycaemia, which can increase insulin sensitivity. However, insulin sensitivity may not be fully restored to normal. High blood glucose levels in Type 2 diabetes patients would typically result in higher insulin values if beta-cell function were normal.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK FACTORS]
The risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity, and is more common in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in individuals with hypertension or dyslipidaemia. The frequency of Type 2 diabetes also varies among different racial and ethnic subgroups. Additionally, there is a strong familial, likely genetic, predisposition to developing Type 2 diabetes, although the genetics are complex and not clearly defined.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND MISDIAGNOSIS]
Some patients with a clinical picture consistent with Type 2 diabetes may actually have autoantibodies similar to those found in Type 1 diabetes, and may be misdiagnosed if antibody determinations are not made. Patients who are non-obese, have relatives with Type 1 diabetes, and are of Northern European origin may be suspected of having late-onset Type 1 diabetes, rather than Type 2 diabetes.
