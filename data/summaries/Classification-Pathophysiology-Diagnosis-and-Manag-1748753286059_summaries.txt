[DIABETES DEFINITION]
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of chronic hyperglycemia, accompanied by impairment in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It is a condition that has been known for over 3000 years, with the first reported case found in an Egyptian manuscript. The disease can be classified into different types, including Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The origin and etiology of DM can vary greatly, but always include defects in either insulin secretion or response.

[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is an immune-mediated condition, while Type 2 diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of DM and results from the interaction between genetic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors. Other forms of diabetes include gestational diabetes, which is related to the gestational hormonal environment, and diabetes caused by genetic defects, infections, and certain drugs.

[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The epidemiology of diabetes has provided valuable information on the natural history, prevalence, incidence, morbidity, and mortality of the disease in diverse populations around the world. According to the International Diabetes Federation Report of 2011, an estimated 366 million people had DM, and this number is expected to increase to 552 million by 2030. The study of epidemiology can help identify the cause of the disease and possible preventive measures to arrest or delay its onset.

[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS]
The diagnosis of diabetes can be made using different approaches, including the 1997 ADA recommendations, which focus on fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, which focus on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is essential for diabetic patients to prevent long-term complications. The diagnosis and management of diabetes require a comprehensive approach, including classification, pathophysiology, and glycemic management.

[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The incidence of diabetes varies across different populations, with the lowest rate found in China (0.1 per 10^5 per year) and the highest in Finland (37 per 10^5 per year). The incidence increases with age, peaking at puberty, and then drops in young women but remains high in young adult males up to 29-35 years old. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people with diabetes will reach 552 million, with the greatest increase in prevalence expected to occur in Asia and Africa.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus has been updated to consolidate etiological views, replacing old terms such as insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) with a new system that identifies four types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, "other specific types", and gestational diabetes. This new classification system aims to provide a clearer understanding of the different forms of diabetes.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES]
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by beta cell destruction caused by an autoimmune process, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This type of diabetes is usually marked by the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell, or insulin antibodies, and eventually, all type 1 diabetic patients will require insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus comprises 80-90% of all cases of diabetes and is often associated with intra-abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This type of diabetes is highly associated with a family history of diabetes, older age, obesity, and lack of exercise, and is more common in women, especially those with a history of gestational diabetes, and in certain ethnic groups such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational diabetes mellitus is an operational classification that identifies women who develop diabetes during pregnancy, including those with undiagnosed asymptomatic type 2 diabetes that is discovered during pregnancy. This type of diabetes is a significant concern due to its potential impact on both mother and child.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Type 2 diabetes carries a high risk of large vessel atherosclerosis, commonly associated with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and obesity, leading to cardiovascular complications and end-stage renal disease. Geographical variation can contribute to the magnitude of these problems and overall morbidity and mortality. Most patients with type 2 diabetes die from cardiovascular complications.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETES]
There is a direct link between hyperglycemia and physiological and behavioral responses, where the brain recognizes hyperglycemia and sends a message to the pancreas and other organs to decrease its effect. This highlights the importance of glucose regulation in the body.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages infiltrating the islets. This autoimmune destruction is associated with the presence of immuno-competent and accessory cells in infiltrated pancreatic islets, as well as the presence of islet cell-specific autoantibodies.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes mellitus can be classified into several types, including type 1, type 2, and other specific types, such as genetic defects in β-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, and disease of the exocrine pancreas. Each type has distinct characteristics and underlying causes, including autoimmune, idiopathic, and genetic factors.

----
[GENETIC DEFECTS AND DIABETES]
Genetic defects can play a significant role in the development of diabetes, including defects in β-cell function, such as MODY 1, 2, and 3, and defects in insulin action, such as type A insulin resistance and leprechaunism. These genetic defects can lead to monogenic diabetes, which has distinct clinical characteristics.

----
[OTHER FORMS OF DIABETES]
Other forms of diabetes include disease of the exocrine pancreas, such as pancreatitis and pancreatectomy, endocrinopathies, such as acromegaly and Cushing syndrome, and pharmacologically or chemically induced diabetes, such as that caused by certain medications like glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones. Infections and infrequent forms of autoimmune diabetes can also occur.
