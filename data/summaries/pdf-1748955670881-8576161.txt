[INTRODUCTION TO DIABETES REPORT]
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a report on the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This report is part of the organization's efforts to address noncommunicable diseases globally. The report is divided into parts, with the first part focusing on the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus. It provides a comprehensive overview of the condition and its various aspects.

----
[WHO REPORT STRUCTURE]
The WHO report is structured to provide a clear understanding of diabetes mellitus, starting with its definition, diagnosis, and classification. The report is the result of a consultation by the WHO Department of Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance, based in Geneva. It aims to standardize the understanding and approach to diabetes care worldwide. The report's structure facilitates easy reference and application of its guidelines.

----
[REPORT OBJECTIVE]
The primary objective of the WHO report is to provide a standardized framework for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus. This framework is designed to help healthcare professionals and researchers consistently diagnose and manage diabetes, ensuring better patient outcomes. By standardizing these aspects, the report aims to improve global diabetes care and management.

[DIABETES DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
Diabetes mellitus is a condition characterized by glucose intolerance, and its diagnosis is based on specific criteria. The definition and diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus and other categories of glucose intolerance are crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. The diagnostic criteria include fasting plasma/blood glucose concentrations and other factors. 

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus has undergone revisions, with earlier classifications being replaced by a new classification system. The revised classification system provides a more accurate and comprehensive framework for understanding and managing diabetes. The new classification has various applications and is supported by epidemiological studies.

----
[CLINICAL STAGING OF DIABETES]
The clinical staging of diabetes mellitus and other categories of glucose tolerance is essential for determining the severity and progression of the disease. The stages include diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose regulation (impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia), and normoglycaemia. Each stage has distinct characteristics and requires specific management approaches.

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Diabetes mellitus can be classified into several aetiological types, including Type 1, Type 2, and other specific types. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, while Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Other specific types of diabetes are listed in Table 3 and have distinct causes and characteristics.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational hyperglycaemia and diabetes are conditions that occur during pregnancy, and their diagnosis is critical for preventing complications. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is based on specific criteria, and it is essential to identify and manage the condition to ensure a healthy pregnancy outcome.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further classified into autoimmune diabetes mellitus and idiopathic types. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly marked by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, and diseases of the exocrine pancreas.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, infections, and uncommon but specific forms of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus. Additionally, other genetic syndromes are sometimes associated with diabetes, highlighting the diverse range of diabetes aetiologies. These types of diabetes have distinct causes and may require different management approaches.

----
[THE METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The metabolic syndrome is a condition related to diabetes, with a definition that encompasses a cluster of metabolic risk factors. The metabolic syndrome is an important concept in diabetes care, as it can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Further research and understanding of the metabolic syndrome are needed to improve diabetes prevention and management.
