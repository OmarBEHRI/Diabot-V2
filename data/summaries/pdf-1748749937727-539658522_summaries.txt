[DIABETES DEFINITION]
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of chronic hyperglycemia, accompanied by impairment in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It is a condition that has been known for over 3000 years, with the first reported case found in an Egyptian manuscript. The disease can be caused by defects in either insulin secretion or response, or in both. DM is a significant health concern, with an estimated 366 million people affected worldwide, and this number is expected to increase to 552 million by 2030.

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
There are different types of diabetes, including Type 1 diabetes, which is immune-mediated or idiopathic, and Type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of DM, characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative insulin deficiency. Type 2 DM results from the interaction between genetic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors. Other forms of diabetes include gestational diabetes, which is related to the gestational hormonal environment, and diabetes caused by genetic defects, infections, and certain drugs.

----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The study of epidemiology has provided valuable information on the natural history, prevalence, incidence, morbidity, and mortality of diabetes in diverse populations around the world. The disease has reached epidemic proportions, and understanding its causes and possible preventive measures is crucial to arresting or delaying its onset. The International Diabetes Federation reported that an estimated 366 million people had DM in 2011, and this number is expected to increase to 552 million by 2030.

----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS]
The diagnosis of diabetes can be made using different approaches, including the 1997 ADA recommendations, which focus on fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, which focus on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is essential for managing the disease and preventing long-term complications.
----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The incidence of diabetes varies across different populations, with the lowest rate found in China (0.1 per 10^5 per year) and the highest in Finland (37 per 10^5 per year). The incidence increases with age, peaking at puberty, and then drops in young women but remains high in young adult males up to 29-35 years old. As many as 50% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed, and the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus has been updated to consolidate etiological views, replacing old terms such as insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) with a new system that identifies four types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, "other specific types", and gestational diabetes. This new classification system aims to provide a clearer understanding of the etiology of diabetes.
----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by beta cell destruction caused by an autoimmune process, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. It is usually identified by the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell, or insulin antibodies, and all Type 1 diabetic patients will eventually require insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus comprises 80-90% of all diabetes cases and is often associated with intra-abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. It is highly associated with a family history of diabetes, older age, obesity, and lack of exercise, and is more common in women, especially those with a history of gestational diabetes, and in certain ethnic groups such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.
----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
Gestational diabetes mellitus is an operational classification that identifies women who develop diabetes during pregnancy, including those with undiagnosed asymptomatic Type 2 diabetes that is discovered during pregnancy. It is a distinct category of diabetes that requires separate consideration and management.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Patients with type 2 diabetes are at a high risk of developing large vessel atherosclerosis, which is often associated with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and obesity. This can lead to cardiovascular complications and end-stage renal disease, accounting for the majority of deaths in patients with type 2 diabetes. Geographical variation can also contribute to the magnitude of these problems and overall morbidity and mortality.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETES]
There is a direct link between hyperglycemia and physiological and behavioral responses. When hyperglycemia occurs, the brain recognizes it and sends a message through nerve impulses to the pancreas and other organs to decrease its effect. This highlights the importance of glucose regulation in the body.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages infiltrating the islets. Several features of type 1 diabetes mellitus indicate that it is an autoimmune disease, including the presence of immuno-competent and accessory cells in infiltrated pancreatic islets and the association of susceptibility to disease with certain genes.

----
[CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES]
Diabetes mellitus can be classified into different types, including type 1, type 2, and other specific types. Type 1 diabetes is autoimmune, while type 2 diabetes ranges from relative insulin deficiency to disorders of insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects in β-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, and disease of the exocrine pancreas.

----
[GENETIC DEFECTS AND DIABETES]
Genetic defects can play a role in the development of diabetes, including defects in β-cell function and insulin action. Examples of genetic defects that can lead to diabetes include chromosome 12, HNF-1α (MODY 3), and chromosome 7, glycosidase (MODY 2). Monogenic diabetes, which is caused by a single genetic mutation, can also occur.

----
[OTHER FORMS OF DIABETES]
Other forms of diabetes include disease of the exocrine pancreas, such as pancreatitis and pancreatectomy, and endocrinopathies, such as acromegaly and Cushing syndrome. Pharmacologically or chemically induced diabetes, infections, and infrequent forms of autoimmune diabetes can also occur. Additionally, certain syndromes, such as Down syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome, can be associated with diabetes.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
Gestational diabetes mellitus occurs in women during gestation and is a distinct form of diabetes. It is not directly related to the other forms of diabetes, but rather is a condition that develops during pregnancy.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetes mellitus is associated with various complications, including macrovascular disease, impaired growth and development, and associated autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and celiac disease. Additionally, patients with diabetes are at risk of developing lipodystrophy, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and infections. These complications can have a significant impact on the quality of life and management of diabetes.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus involves screening for patients with risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and a family history of diabetes. Early intervention through screening can potentially reduce future complication rates. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends using Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) for diagnosis, while the World Health Organization (WHO) focuses on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES]
There are several diagnostic tests for diabetes, including the random plasma test, which is the simplest test and does not require fasting. The fasting plasma glucose test requires an 8-hour fast and confirms a diabetes diagnosis if blood glucose is more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests conducted on different days. These tests are essential for diagnosing and managing diabetes effectively.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS]
Early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial, as approximately 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes already have microvascular complications at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that they have had the disease for more than 5 years. Early intervention and screening can help reduce the risk of complications and improve patient outcomes.
----
[ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST]
The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted when the random plasma glucose test is 160-200 mg/dl and the fasting plasma test is 110-125 mg/dl. This test evaluates the body's response to glucose and requires fasting for 8-16 hours. The test involves giving 75 gm of glucose and testing blood glucose levels every 30 minutes to 1 hour for 2-3 hours. A glucose level of less than 140 mg/dl at 2 hours is considered normal.
----
[GLYCATED PROTEINS]
Glycated proteins are formed when proteins react with glucose in the blood, and the extent of glycation is controlled by glucose concentration and the number of reactive amino groups in the protein. Glycated proteins can be measured in blood and serve as a marker for fluctuations in blood glucose concentrations over a certain period. Proteins with longer lifetimes in the blood are of interest for clinical diagnosis, as they reflect exposure to glucose over longer periods.
----
[GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN]
Glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) is a ketoamine compound formed by the combination of hemoglobin A and glucose, with a lifetime of 90-120 days. HbA1c is a retrospective indicator of average glucose concentration and is recommended as an essential indicator for monitoring blood glucose control. A blood HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher is considered diagnostic for diabetes.
----
[DIABETES SCREENING AND MONITORING]
Patients at risk for diabetes should be screened every 2 years using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin, or both. If diabetes is suspected, screening should be repeated in 1-3 years. For patients with prediabetes, lifestyle changes should be initiated, and FPG and glycated hemoglobin should be checked every 12 months. For patients with diabetes, treatment should be dependent on the degree of hyperglycemia, and lifestyle changes should be continued, with metformin considered if necessary.
----
[INPATIENT DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
For hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia but not critically ill, glycated hemoglobin should be measured. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, or newly diagnosed diabetes, should continue their outpatient regimen if glucose is well-controlled. Basal insulin doses should be started at 0.2-0.3 u/kg/day, with correction insulin for blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl. If glucose is not well-controlled, basal insulin and prandial insulin should be initiated, with correction insulin for blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl.
----
[FRUCTOSAMINE TEST]
The fructosamine test measures glycated albumin, which serves as a marker to monitor blood glucose levels. This test provides a retrospective measure of average blood glucose concentration over a period of 1 to 3 weeks, with a reference interval of 205-285 micro mol/L. Glycated albumin is formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and albumin in plasma. This test can be used to assess blood glucose control.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is made if two or more plasma glucose values meet or exceed certain thresholds. Women at high risk of GDM, such as those with a positive family history or marked obesity, should be screened as soon as feasible, and retested at 24-28 weeks if the initial screening is negative. An oral glucose tolerance test should be performed at least 6 weeks after pregnancy ends to reclassify the woman as having diabetes, normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose.

----
[GLYCEMIC MEASURES AND RISK ASSESSMENT]
The risk of complications of diabetes may differ depending on whether the disease was diagnosed by fasting plasma glucose testing or glycated hemoglobin testing. Research suggests that glycated hemoglobin level may be a better predictor of certain complications, such as cardiovascular disease. Ongoing research is assessing the value of risk scores that incorporate glycemic measures, biomarkers, and risk factors to estimate diabetes risk.

----
[IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE AND DIAGNOSIS]
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dl, while increased glycated hemoglobin (IGH) is defined as a glycated hemoglobin level of 5.7 to 6.4%. The diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed with a repeat test on a separate day or by an alternative test, such as glycated hemoglobin instead of fasting plasma glucose. If the result of the repeat test is in the prediabetic range, the patient should be counseled or treated for pre-diabetes.

----
[GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT AND FOLLOW-UP]
Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is crucial for individuals with diabetes to prevent long-term complications. Strict metabolic control can delay or prevent the progression of complications associated with diabetes. Studies have shown that control of insulin resistance, family history, and ethnicity can help identify individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Regular follow-up and counseling can help individuals with diabetes manage their condition and prevent complications.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Glycemic control is crucial in delaying the onset and slowing the progression of microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Adequate glycemic control, along with preventing complications, disability limitation, and rehabilitation, are essential needs of diabetic patients. Poor adherence to treatment regimens due to poor attitude towards the disease and poor health literacy can hinder effective management. 

----
[DETERMINING GLYCEMIC GOALS]
Glycemic goals should be determined by considering factors such as psychosocial limitations. In patients with "hypoglycemia unawareness," glycemic targets should be relaxed for prolonged periods, pending potential reversal of the condition. For patients with severe coexisting conditions, the goal is to prevent clinically significant glycosuria, water and electrolyte loss, infections, and non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma.

----
[INSULIN THERAPY]
Insulin is indicated for type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetic patients with insulinopenia whose hyperglycemia does not respond to diet therapy or oral hypoglycemic drugs. Controlling blood glucose with insulin has the potential to be the most effective blood glucose-lowering therapy. Many patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require insulin therapy, with insulin requirements potentially exceeding 1 unit/kg/day due to insulin resistance.

----
[FUTURE CHALLENGES IN DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
The high prevalence of diabetes imposes a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and individuals living with the disease. Implementing preventive and curative measures, such as lifestyle modifications and providing nutritional information, is essential to address the growing number of undiagnosed patients and the impact of diabetes on patient quality of life and healthcare costs.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS]
The American Diabetes Association (2010) provides guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus, which is essential for proper management and treatment. The classification of diabetes includes Type 1, Type 2, and other forms of diabetes. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for developing effective treatment plans. The diagnosis of diabetes can be made using various tests, including glycated hemoglobin (A1c) assays.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]
Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. The pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes involves multiple factors, including genetic and environmental factors. Understanding the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Research has shown that the onset of Type 2 diabetes occurs at least 4-7 years before clinical diagnosis.

----
[DIABETES MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT]
The American Diabetes Association (2011) provides standards of medical care in diabetes, which include guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and management of diabetes. Intensive blood-glucose control with sulphonylureas or insulin can reduce the risk of complications in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and other studies have demonstrated the importance of intensive blood-glucose control in preventing microvascular complications.

----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS AND RISK FACTORS]
Diabetes can lead to various complications, including microvascular and macrovascular complications. The risk of complications can be reduced by intensive blood-glucose control and management of other risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Research has identified several biomarkers that can predict the risk of developing diabetes, including glycated hemoglobin and other serum biomarkers.

----
[PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE IN DIABETES]
Psychosocial care is an essential aspect of diabetes management, and it can have a significant impact on the quality of life of individuals with diabetes. Improving psychosocial care can involve various strategies, including patient education, counseling, and support groups. The Indian experience has shown that improving psychosocial care can lead to better outcomes in individuals with diabetes.
