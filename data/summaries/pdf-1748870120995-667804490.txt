[INTRODUCTION TO DIABETES REPORT]
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a report on the definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This report is part of the organization's efforts to address noncommunicable diseases globally. The report is divided into parts, with the first part focusing on the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus. It provides a comprehensive overview of the condition and its various aspects.

----
[WHO REPORT STRUCTURE]
The WHO report is structured to provide a clear understanding of diabetes mellitus, starting with its definition, diagnosis, and classification. The report aims to establish a standardized approach to diagnosing and managing diabetes, which is essential for effective treatment and prevention of complications. The report's structure reflects the organization's commitment to providing accurate and reliable information on noncommunicable diseases.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION IMPORTANCE]
The classification of diabetes mellitus is crucial for developing effective treatment plans and preventing complications. Accurate diagnosis and classification enable healthcare professionals to provide personalized care and management strategies for individuals with diabetes. The WHO report emphasizes the importance of a standardized classification system to ensure consistency in diagnosis and treatment worldwide.

[DIABETES DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA]
Diabetes mellitus is a condition with specific diagnostic criteria, including definitions and categories of glucose intolerance. The diagnosis of diabetes involves various factors, including fasting plasma or blood glucose concentrations. Diagnostic criteria have undergone changes, with updates to the diagnostic values for fasting plasma/blood glucose concentrations. 

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes has evolved, with earlier classifications being revised to better reflect the condition's complexity. The revised classification system aims to provide a more accurate and comprehensive framework for understanding diabetes. This system includes terminology and application guidelines to facilitate individual diagnosis and epidemiological studies.

----
[CLINICAL STAGING OF DIABETES]
The clinical staging of diabetes mellitus and other categories of glucose tolerance involves several stages, including diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose regulation, and normoglycaemia. Impaired glucose regulation includes impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia, while normoglycaemia represents normal glucose levels. This staging system helps healthcare professionals diagnose and manage diabetes effectively.

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Diabetes can be classified into several aetiological types, including Type 1, Type 2, and other specific types. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, while Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Other specific types of diabetes are listed in Table 3 and are important for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES]
Gestational hyperglycaemia and diabetes refer to high blood sugar levels that develop during pregnancy. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves specific criteria and guidelines, which are crucial for managing the condition and preventing complications for both the mother and the baby.
----
[DIABETES TYPES]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and can be further classified into autoimmune diabetes mellitus and idiopathic types. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly marked by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency or an insulin secretory defect with or without insulin resistance. Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes.

----
[OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES]
Other specific types of diabetes include genetic defects of beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, infections, and uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus. These types of diabetes are less common but still important to recognize and manage appropriately. Genetic syndromes sometimes associated with diabetes are also included in this category.

----
[THE METABOLIC SYNDROME]
The metabolic syndrome is a condition related to diabetes, but its definition and future needs are still being studied and refined. The metabolic syndrome is discussed in more detail in section 8 of the textbook, which includes its definition and future needs. Understanding the metabolic syndrome is important for comprehensive diabetes care and management. 

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS]
The oral glucose tolerance test is a diagnostic tool used to assess glucose metabolism and diagnose diabetes, with methods and procedures outlined in Annex 1 of the textbook. Additionally, methods for measuring substances in blood and urine are described in Annex 2, providing valuable information for diabetes diagnosis and monitoring. These diagnostic tests are essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management of diabetes.
