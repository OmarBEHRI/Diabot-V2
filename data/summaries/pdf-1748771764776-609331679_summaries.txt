[DIABETES DEFINITION]
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of chronic hyperglycemia, accompanied by impairment in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It is a condition that has been known for thousands of years, with the first reported case in an Egyptian manuscript about 3000 years ago. The origin and etiology of DM can vary greatly, but always include defects in either insulin secretion or response, or in both. DM is probably one of the oldest diseases known to man.

----
[DIABETES TYPES]
There are different types of diabetes, including Type 1 diabetes, which is immune-mediated or idiopathic, and Type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of DM, characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative insulin deficiency. Type 2 DM results from the interaction between genetic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors. Other forms of diabetes include gestational diabetes, which is related to the gestational hormonal environment, and diabetes caused by genetic defects, infections, and certain drugs.

----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The epidemiology of DM has provided valuable information on the natural history, prevalence, incidence, morbidity, and mortality of the disease in diverse populations around the world. According to the International Diabetes Federation Report of 2011, an estimated 366 million people had DM, and this number is expected to increase to around 552 million by 2030. The study of epidemiology can help identify the cause of the disease and possible preventive measures to arrest or delay its onset.

----
[DIABETES DIAGNOSIS]
There are different approaches to diagnose diabetes, including the 1997 ADA recommendations, which focus on fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), and the WHO, which focuses on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is of great significance in averting any long-term complications of diabetes. The diagnosis of DM is crucial for the management and treatment of the disease, and it is essential to follow established guidelines and recommendations.
----
[DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY]
The incidence of diabetes varies across different populations, with the lowest rate found in China (0.1 per 10^5 per year) and the highest in Finland (37 per 10^5 per year). The incidence increases with age, peaking at puberty, and then drops in young women but remains high in young adult males up to 29-35 years old. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people with diabetes will reach 552 million, with the greatest increase in prevalence expected to occur in Asia and Africa.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
The classification of diabetes mellitus has been updated to consolidate etiological views, replacing old terms such as insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) with a new system that identifies four types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, "other specific types", and gestational diabetes. This new classification system aims to provide a clearer understanding of the different types of diabetes and their underlying causes.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by beta cell destruction caused by an autoimmune process, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This type of diabetes is usually marked by the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell, or insulin antibodies, which identify the autoimmune processes that lead to beta cell destruction. Eventually, all type 1 diabetic patients will require insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia.

----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus comprises 80-90% of all cases of diabetes and is often associated with intra-abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This type of diabetes is highly associated with a family history of diabetes, older age, obesity, and lack of exercise, and is more common in women, especially those with a history of gestational diabetes, and in certain ethnic groups such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.

----
[GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
Gestational diabetes mellitus is an operational classification that identifies women who develop diabetes during pregnancy, including those with undiagnosed asymptomatic type 2 diabetes that is discovered during pregnancy. This type of diabetes is a significant concern due to its potential impact on both the mother and the fetus.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Type 2 diabetes carries a high risk of large vessel atherosclerosis, commonly associated with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and obesity, leading to cardiovascular complications and end-stage renal disease. Geographical variation can contribute to the magnitude of these problems and overall morbidity and mortality. Most patients with type 2 diabetes die from these complications.

----
[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETES]
There is a direct link between hyperglycemia and physiological and behavioral responses, where the brain recognizes hyperglycemia and sends a message to the pancreas and other organs to decrease its effect. This highlights the importance of glucose regulation in the body.

----
[TYPE 1 DIABETES CHARACTERISTICS]
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages infiltrating the islets. This autoimmune response is marked by the presence of immuno-competent and accessory cells in infiltrated pancreatic islets, association with class II genes of the major histocompatibility complex, and the presence of islet cell-specific autoantibodies.

----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION]
Diabetes mellitus can be classified into several types, including type 1, type 2, and other specific types, such as genetic defects in β-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, and disease of the exocrine pancreas. Each type has distinct characteristics and underlying causes, including autoimmune, idiopathic, and genetic factors.

----
[GENETIC DEFECTS AND DIABETES]
Genetic defects can play a significant role in the development of diabetes, including defects in β-cell function, such as MODY 1, 2, and 3, and defects in insulin action, such as type A insulin resistance and leprechaunism. These genetic defects can lead to monogenic diabetes, which has distinct clinical characteristics and management requirements.

----
[OTHER FORMS OF DIABETES]
Other forms of diabetes include disease of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, pharmacologically or chemically induced diabetes, and infections. These forms of diabetes can have distinct underlying causes and clinical presentations, and may require specialized management and treatment.
----
[DIABETES COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetes is associated with various complications, including macrovascular disease, impaired growth and development, and associated autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and celiac disease. Additionally, patients with diabetes are at risk of developing lipodystrophy, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These complications can have a significant impact on the quality of life and management of diabetes.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES]
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus involves screening patients with risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and a family history of diabetes. Early intervention can potentially reduce future complication rates, and various approaches can be used to diagnose diabetes, including the Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) test and the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends using FPG for diagnosis, while the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends OGTT.

----
[DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES]
Several diagnostic tests can be used to diagnose diabetes, including a random plasma test, fasting plasma glucose test, and oral glucose tolerance test. A random plasma test is the simplest test and does not require fasting, while a fasting plasma glucose test requires an 8-hour fast and a blood glucose level of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests to confirm a diabetes diagnosis. These tests can help identify patients with diabetes and enable early intervention.

----
[IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS]
Early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial, as approximately 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes already have microvascular complications at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that they have had the disease for more than 5 years. Early intervention can potentially reduce the risk of complications and improve patient outcomes, highlighting the importance of screening and diagnosis in patients with risk factors for diabetes.
----
[ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST]
The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted when the random plasma glucose test is 160-200 mg/dl and the fasting plasma test is 110-125 mg/dl. This test evaluates the body's response to glucose and requires fasting for 8-16 hours. The test involves giving 75 gm of glucose and testing blood glucose levels every 30 minutes to 1 hour for 2-3 hours. A glucose level of less than 140 mg/dl at 2 hours is considered normal.

----
[GLYCATED PROTEINS]
Glycated proteins are formed when proteins react with glucose in the blood, and the extent of glycation is controlled by glucose concentration and the number of reactive amino groups in the protein. Glycated proteins can be measured in blood and serve as a marker for fluctuations in blood glucose concentrations over a certain period. Proteins with longer lifetimes in the blood are of interest for clinical diagnosis, as they reflect exposure to glucose for longer periods.

----
[GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN]
Glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) is a ketoamine compound formed by the combination of hemoglobin A and glucose, with a lifetime of 90-120 days. HbA1c is a retrospective indicator of average glucose concentration and is recommended as an essential indicator for monitoring blood glucose control. A blood HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher is considered diagnostic for diabetes.

----
[DIABETES SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS]
The suggested approach to screening patients at risk for diabetes involves checking fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin every 2 years for normal individuals, and every 1-3 years for those with prediabetes or suspected diabetes. Lifestyle changes are recommended for those with prediabetes, while those with diabetes require treatment dependent on the degree of hyperglycemia.

----
[MANAGING HYPERGLYCEMIA IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS]
For hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia but not critically ill, glycated hemoglobin should be measured. Patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes, or newly diagnosed diabetes, should continue their outpatient regimen if glucose is well-controlled. Basal insulin doses of 0.2-0.3 u/kg/day or insulin every 12-24 hours, plus correction insulin for blood glucose > 150 mg/dl, may be initiated if glucose is not well-controlled.
----
[FRUCTOSAMINE TEST]
Fructosamine testing measures glycated albumin, which serves as a marker to monitor blood glucose levels, providing a retrospective measure of average blood glucose concentration over a period of 1 to 3 weeks. The reference interval for glycated albumin is 205-285 micro mol/L. This test can be used to assess blood glucose control. Glycated albumin is formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and albumin in plasma.

----
[DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS]
The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is made if two or more of the plasma glucose values are met or exceeded. Women at high risk, such as those with a positive family history or marked obesity, should be screened as soon as feasible, and if the initial screening is negative, they should undergo retesting at 24-48 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test should be performed at least 6 weeks after the pregnancy ends to reclassify the woman as having diabetes, normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose.

----
[GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT]
Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is crucial for individuals with diabetes to prevent long-term complications. Strict metabolic control can delay or prevent the progression of complications associated with diabetes. Studies have shown that controlling insulin resistance and other factors can improve outcomes for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Healthcare providers play a significant role in addressing the continued needs and demands of individuals with chronic illnesses like diabetes.

----
[DEFINITION OF IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE]
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 100 to 125 mg/dl (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/liter), while increased glycated hemoglobin (IGH) is defined as a glycated hemoglobin level of 5.7 to 6.4%. The diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed with a repeat test on a separate day or by an alternative test, such as glycated hemoglobin instead of FPG or vice versa. If the result of the repeat test is in the prediabetic range, the patient should be counseled or treated for pre-diabetes.

----
[RISK FACTORS FOR DIABETES]
Several risk factors are associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, including insulin resistance, family history of type 2 diabetes, ethnicity (such as African-American, Hispanic, or Native American), small size for gestational age, maternal gestational diabetes, and insulin resistance of puberty. These risk factors can help identify individuals who may be at higher risk of developing diabetes and may benefit from early screening and intervention.
----
[IMPORTANCE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL]
Glycemic control is crucial in delaying the onset and slowing the progression of microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Additionally, glycemic control should be balanced with preventing complications, disability limitation, and rehabilitation. Poor adherence to treatment regimens due to poor attitude towards the disease and poor health literacy can hinder effective glycemic control.
----
[DETERMINING GLYCEMIC GOALS]
Glycemic goals should be determined based on various factors, including psychosocial limitations. In patients with "hypoglycemia unawareness," glycemic targets should be relaxed for prolonged periods, pending the potential reversal of the condition. For patients with severe coexisting conditions, the goal is to prevent clinically significant glycosuria, water and electrolyte loss, infections, and non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma.
----
[INSULIN THERAPY]
Insulin is indicated for type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetic patients with insulinopenia whose hyperglycemia does not respond to diet therapy or oral hypoglycemic drugs. Controlling blood glucose with insulin has the potential to be the most effective blood glucose-lowering therapy. Many patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require insulin therapy, with insulin requirements potentially exceeding 1 unit/kg/day due to insulin resistance.
----
[FUTURE CHALLENGES IN DIABETES CARE]
The high prevalence of diabetes imposes a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and individuals living with the disease. To address this, implementation of preventive and curative measures, such as lifestyle modification and provision of nutritional information, is essential. Basic science research will play a crucial role in developing new directions for prevention and treatment of diabetes.
----
[DIABETES CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS]
The American Diabetes Association (2010) provides guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus, which is crucial for effective management and treatment. Diagnosis of diabetes is typically made based on clinical presentation and laboratory tests, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The HbA1c assay is a widely accepted diagnostic tool for diabetes. 
----
[DIABETES PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND COMPLICATIONS]
The pathogenesis of diabetes involves complex mechanisms, including insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, leading to hyperglycemia and various complications. Chronic hyperglycemia can cause microvascular and macrovascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. Understanding the pathophysiology of diabetes is essential for developing effective treatment strategies.
----
[TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK MODELS AND BIOMARKERS]
Several studies have identified biomarkers and developed risk models for predicting type 2 diabetes, including the use of serum biomarkers from the Inter99 cohort. These models can help identify individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, allowing for early intervention and prevention. Novel biomarkers, such as those identified in the Salomaa et al. (2010) study, can also predict clinically incident diabetes.
----
[DIABETES TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT]
Intensive blood-glucose control with sulphonylureas or insulin has been shown to reduce the risk of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes, as demonstrated in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS 33). The American Diabetes Association (2012) provides standards of medical care in diabetes, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatment plans and ongoing monitoring to achieve optimal glycemic control.
----
[PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT]
Psychosocial care is an essential aspect of diabetes management, as highlighted in the Indian experience reported by Shobana et al. (2005). Improving psychosocial care can have a positive impact on diabetes outcomes, and healthcare providers should prioritize this aspect of care to support patients with diabetes.
